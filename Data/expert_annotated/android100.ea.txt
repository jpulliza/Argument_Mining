Sorry for the sarcasm, but coming from both Android and Windows Mobile to the iPhone it's clear  that Apple still have a way to go. Hardware buttons are necessary (capacitive buttons like on the  Nexus One are mostly acceptable) because they make certain actions easier and quicker to perform.

Not being able to look at an email  without closing an ssh session or remote desktop is painful.  Oh, and the way it doesn't mount as a  usb drive and let you do what you want with folders of video and music is painful.  On the other hand, from what I've seen with Android, it's not so much the differences in the UI,  it's the inconsistency from one part of the UI to another.  It's the classic linux desktop problem.   It's so open that everything on it has its own way of working and interacting.  The best thing about Android is that it pushes the rest of the market ever harder.  Apple has such a loyal fanbase because they focus on making feel good about their gear with  innovations that even when minor, really add up.  To wit:  Why is it that it's only my iPhone/iTouch that pauses music if the headphone jack gets unplugged?  Why is that it's only my iPhone/iTouch that changes the volume setting when I go from no headphones  (speaker) to headphones by plugging in the jack --- then goes BACK to loud when I unplug them?  Why hasn't anyone else figured out how to let you have pause/play and volume button on the earbuds  without making an incompatible jack?  I'm no apple fanboy --- in fact I prefer my windows 7 machines over a macbook --- but you've got to  hand it to Apple, they do treat their users to a smooth working ui."

I know, that seems  silly, but I've used that timer a lot for cooking etc. With the NexusOne, I had to go find a timer  *app*!  I'm also never completely certain whether an app has quit or is still in the background using  battery, something I never had to worry about on my iPhone.  Pros:  Google Goggles totally rocks! I am amazed at the camera and ability to search with it for things  like *wines*.  Google Voice built-in!  Maps -Wow. The maps are beautiful. And the turn-by-turn navigation is built-in!  Car-Home is a pretty kewl feature. All the right buttons for when you're in the car. Still -- it  would be nice if the headset could initiate voice-search somehow.  The alt-tab like feature is pretty nifty.  And I kinda like the window-shade notification system.  GMail is quite nice -- although I tend to start with the oldest unread and go for newer, but I'm  okay with the built-in way to do it.  All in all, I'm getting used to the NexusOne remarkably quickly -- and so far, really enjoying it."
