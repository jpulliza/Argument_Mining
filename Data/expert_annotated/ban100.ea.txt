Truth is that file sharing in fact has been a boon to  truly independent filmmakers and other non affiliated content producers, because they've become  better known; it only really harms the big sharks, who have been robbing everyone blind and  suppressing the little guy for decades.  Is it forever sustainable?  No, but turning the reins over  to the RIAA and groups like them isn't the way to go about it.  Studies have proven people do  prefer to do things right, file sharing and the entire music and movie industry needs to be  re-envisioned.  A service which becomes a mix of iTunes and P2P, where independent content produces  set their own prices, and not companies like Apple or Amazon, and where they're not ignored by Sony  Music, Universal, etc. who before had the final say, will win against every other P2P form out  there.  The proof exists in that music CDs remain the most popular form of distribution and in the  correlation that as the array of music grows in services like Amazon and iTunes, the greater those  services sales are, and the more the sales of those CDs drop.  It should be clear to anyone but the  most casual observer that the main problem is the greed of the copyright holders to try to garner  every penny they can as if every piece of content they owned was new and gold.  If they were to  more reasonably pro-rate their work, on a iTunes/P2P-mix network where even the little guy can set  their own prices, we'd ALL be a whole lot happier in the long run."

Truth is that file sharing in fact has been a boon to  truly independent filmmakers and other non affiliated content producers, because they've become  better known; it only really harms the big sharks, who have been robbing everyone blind and  suppressing the little guy for decades.  Is it forever sustainable?  No, but turning the reins over  to the RIAA and groups like them isn't the way to go about it.  Studies have proven people do  prefer to do things right, file sharing and the entire music and movie industry needs to be  re-envisioned.  A service which becomes a mix of iTunes and P2P, where independent content produces  set their own prices, and not companies like Apple or Amazon, and where they're not ignored by Sony  Music, Universal, etc. who before had the final say, will win against every other P2P form out  there.  The proof exists in that music CDs remain the most popular form of distribution and in the  correlation that as the array of music grows in services like Amazon and iTunes, the greater those  services sales are, and the more the sales of those CDs drop.  It should be clear to anyone but the  most casual observer that the main problem is the greed of the copyright holders to try to garner  every penny they can as if every piece of content they owned was new and gold.  If they were to  more reasonably pro-rate their work, on a iTunes/P2P-mix network where even the little guy can set  their own prices, we'd ALL be a whole lot happier in the long run."

Read the goddamn consitution. When some makes a product, it  is your property. Your work. And it is up to the individual to make money or do WHATEVER THEY WANT  WITH IT. WHY? BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS BASED ON PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY.     Your neighbor can look at your lawnmower or car and say, I want that, I'll just take it But they  don't because we have agreed to make it illegal enforced by sanction. So we don't steal from each  other because.......WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE OUR STUFF (PROPERTY) STOLEN so we agree not to do it to  each other.   Duping a movie or song file without paying for it is NO DIFFERENT THAN STEALING A CAR SOMEONE HAS  MADE WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. Just because it is so easy to do, doesn;t justify it. How would all you  shit for brains like it if I logged into your bank and took 10 bucks for myself now and then. WHY  SHOULD YOU MIND? WHAT ARE YOU GREEDY?    yes, people will always find a way around copy protection. But stealing some's work without  permission or paying IS WRONG.   And by the way, all you stupid fucks fall for the term file sharing like its some right to freely  copy digital property without permission or paying for it.   NO I'm not for the government tracking our P.C's. I 100% against it.    Yes, the tape era wasn;t harmful. But when Digital can copy the source so well, or the internet  makes it absurdly easy to do, then there is a problem.   When you do this, you kill the artist or the developer of the sofware. Not to mention the jobs  that go along with it. People who work in plastics plants, the secretarys, the salesment, the  truckdrivers, the advertisers. ECT.    Wake the fuck up you stupid fucks.

You aren't sharing anything. It's just a eufimisom for STEALING, and  that's exactly what it is. It cheats the creator out of their money. For those of you who believe  it doesn't hurt the person (i.e. Nicole Kidman) because they are rich, perhaps you are right.  However, it doesn't make it less of theft and it doesn't make it less wrong. Anyone who got as far  as they did now, did it through hard work and is still working hard; it's their money and they  deserve it. Stealing files means that one person buys it rather than the thousand that share it. If  America follows suit it will be a good thing.  On that note however, a full out ban does seem a little extreme. There is a similar law going on in  parts of America, the offender found downloading songs has to pay for them in the end, and much  more than buying the albums would have cost. One college student was charge over 30,000 dollars I  believe. For those of you who are so up in arms about this, regardless of the fact that it's  punnishment for a crime, just like jail time for a bank robber, stop being stupid, it doesn't  affect you that greatly yet, and likely wont.
