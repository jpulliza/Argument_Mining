Sounds a lot like  what Google said you'd use a Chrome OS netbook for.  But you are missing one important factor that fueled netbooks popularity: price.  The cheapest iPad is 499, but when you start adding accessories and 3G, that price climbs faster  that you can say apple tax, you're paying more for accessories that already come with netbooks (3g,  usb, keyboard).  So you could buy a 300 bucks netbook or a 700$ iPad and still have a better web experience on a  netbook. I'm just not seeing people buying the iPad over a netbook, I want to, but I can't.  Then there's the familiarity issue, 90% of people live in the Office/PC world, is going to be very  hard to get people out of that world, however, is gonna be easier to get people to use the web  version of Office on a Chrome OS netbook than to jump over to the Apple world.  Plus, a Googler said last year that they'd bring gDocs up to par with Office this year, probably to  coincide with the Chrome OS launch, if they can deliver on providing a similar experience to  Office, is gonna be harder for Apple to convince people to use iWork on the iPad.

The Netbook user interface is essentially identical to a PC, no matter what size of screen is used.   No effort is put into trying to make the interface work better with the smaller screen.  For example, if I pull up a new word processing window on a netbook, it inhabits a portion of the  screen, just as it would on a computer with a huge screen.  It seems more logical to me for it to  take up the whole screen with a smaller size, but nobody thought of that; they just did things the  way they have always been done.  On the iPad, all applications fill up the whole screen, just as they should to take advantage of  the full resolution/size.  And applications will be designed to configure themselves differently  whether on an iPhone or an iPad.  Intelligent."

Not least in the number of developers."	opposition_Instance_50350	23444	25422	"Both of you got me wrong (hexley and Bror), which might mean i explained wrong, or  you're too eager to defend the iPad.  The examples i gave are just current ones. Solve them and you'll have new ones.  Yes, there would be some good applications for the iPad for a lot of things, but they'll always be  behind what's out there, both in quantity AND quality because there's simply a limit to what a  limited number of developers can do, and there's a limit to how many applications you can cram in  one store, and there's a limit to how many apps the Apple approval staff (or bots or whatever they  are) can review...  Those limits are inherited in a system that is, well, limiting.  The same, perhaps even more importantly, goes for the form factor. The iPad has some good things  going for it, industrial-design wise (like weight, speed, battery life) but also some serious  drawbacks (i personally believe that the virtual keyboard, with the way it is implemented in this  specific machine, will fail as a serious input device).  By giving the operating system (two of them, in fact) out to manufacturers, Google is creating a  prosperity in form factors and encourages the creativity of those manufacturers to develop better  solutions both technologically and ergonomically.  And let's not forget that there are other contenders as well. Microsoft had not said their last  word in the mobile space. Nokia has been in the MID business for a while now and they're not giving  up easily…  So, what I'm saying is not that the iPad would necessarily fail, but that the Apple approach of  centralized, totalitarian-like control over every aspect of a product would eventually fail.  In the short term they look smarter cuz they make wonderfully crafted devices. In the long term  they loose because people are different, and they have different needs, and they need diversity.  Either Aple opens up their approach or they start loosing what they so painfuly just recently  gained."

I agree these two products are on a collision course, I've heard a lot of people lately trying to  come up with ways they'd use the iPad, and one of them is using the iPad as a web-tablet that you  can have around the house to quickly pickup and check email or google something. Sounds a lot like  what Google said you'd use a Chrome OS netbook for.  But you are missing one important factor that fueled netbooks popularity: price.  The cheapest iPad is 499, but when you start adding accessories and 3G, that price climbs faster  that you can say apple tax, you're paying more for accessories that already come with netbooks (3g,  usb, keyboard).  So you could buy a 300 bucks netbook or a 700$ iPad and still have a better web experience on a  netbook. I'm just not seeing people buying the iPad over a netbook, I want to, but I can't.  Then there's the familiarity issue, 90% of people live in the Office/PC world, is going to be very  hard to get people out of that world, however, is gonna be easier to get people to use the web  version of Office on a Chrome OS netbook than to jump over to the Apple world.  Plus, a Googler said last year that they'd bring gDocs up to par with Office this year, probably to  coincide with the Chrome OS launch, if they can deliver on providing a similar experience to  Office, is gonna be harder for Apple to convince people to use iWork on the iPad.  That's my two cents, I have little doubt these two products are on a collision course, but I'm  putting my money on that cost of ownership will decide the winner."

No effort is put into trying to make the interface work better with the smaller screen.

Applications are already configured to rearrange themselves depending on the resolution they have  to run at.  It even conforms to how I want to use it, should I want to switch back to windowed operation like a  standard desktop, my applications will behave there as well.  Even Google understands that netbooks should  run applications in fullscreen -- ever booted  ChromeOS? It's just a full-screen version of Chrome with a clock.  That's just a few of the Netbook optimized options out there. The difference in design philosophy  is certainly there, the UI's in Linux were designed with this sort of requirement in mind from day  1, there is no upscaling required for legacy applications."

If typing is your thing, then  a netbook will suit. If you want a device that is easy to use on PT, a cafe, at meeting, or  collaborating  then a tablet will prove to be more useful.  Also take the fact the Apple controls the entire experience from silicon to UI will ultimately  tighten the user experience to the point that people won't see it like a computer, but rather a  device (like a toaster) that is a no-brainer to use.  I just hope the frenemies are still close enough so that Google Docs can be a worth while  experience. Tablet + Google Docs to me would be a killer application."

It's still in testing stages, it's still  dependent on Google writing drivers to address the hardware in specific laptops and you may or may  not want to use yet another laptop just because it's a netbook.  The thing that is funny to watch is when netbooks came out there was this perception that everyone  was going to toss out their current laptop and instantly buy a netbook. When that did not happen,  those who did toss out their laptop went OH DANG!!! I miss my laptop and then had a netbook which  made it to craigslist and a laptop that they went back to because it never did enough for them.  iPad does solve a problem. It provides a platform for those of us who use our iPhones or Touch's to  do certain things but wish that the screen was larger at points in time. It's not a full laptop but  it has a screen that puts ANY netbook to shame and speedwise was quite impressive.  Sure ChromeOS when it comes out will be nice in some regards and fill some niche. However when your  email goes out via GMAIL it is on the web and you cannot get to it. We've seen this with Gmail  outages time and again. The iPad can either leave your email on the server of me.com or on your own  hosted servers, or it can probably inhale it and then synch it back somewhere else later on.  ChromeOS competes with WindowsXP, VISTA, 7. It does not stack up against OSX or the iPhone OS which  is out there on millions of platforms (touchs, iphones, and soon iPads). It will be slow in getting  out there, no matter how many people say differently as we've seen things take time to entrench  before.  iPad will sell. I am planning the things to add to mine already when it's home with me in around 90  days."

I either used  (Open)Office suit of apps where serious work is needed, or used Google apps where cloud based  access is needed. Simply iWork is either not powerful enough for serious work, or not economical  enough for cloud based access.  I might still buy an iPad, but not for the reasons you mentioned here."

The Netbook user interface is essentially identical to a PC, no matter what size of screen is used.   No effort is put into trying to make the interface work better with the smaller screen.  For example, if I pull up a new word processing window on a netbook, it inhabits a portion of the  screen, just as it would on a computer with a huge screen.  It seems more logical to me for it to  take up the whole screen with a smaller size, but nobody thought of that; they just did things the  way they have always been done.  On the iPad, all applications fill up the whole screen, just as they should to take advantage of  the full resolution/size.  And applications will be designed to configure themselves differently  whether on an iPhone or an iPad.  Intelligent.  Now, that's a slightly silly example, obviously.  I  can fix the problem on the netbook by hitting  the Maximize button and then the application will fill the screen.  At the same time, it shows a genuine difference in design philosophy.  The way I look at it, Apple makes designer computers.  They are meant to look great and conform  nicely to how you want to use them.  That was how I thought of Apple before the iPhone, but the  iPhone and iPad have carried this to the next level.  You can buy a designer computer, or a  Wal*Mart computer.  The former has been carefully crafted to fit, the latter is just thrown out on  the shelves.  I would call that real innovation, and I'm sure that when I get my hands on an iPad, I will notice  a lot more built into the product."

You could develop something for Android, and there's no guarantee that it  will even work on all android phones.  Plus, they have not done a good job training their users to  pay for apps, so you'll hardly make any money even if it's one of the best apps on the platform.

On the iPad, all applications fill up the whole screen, just as they should to take advantage of  the full resolution/size.  And applications will be designed to configure themselves differently  whether on an iPhone or an iPad.  Intelligent.  Now, that's a slightly silly example, obviously.  I  can fix the problem on the netbook by hitting  the Maximize button and then the application will fill the screen.  At the same time, it shows a genuine difference in design philosophy.  The way I look at it, Apple makes designer computers.  They are meant to look great and conform  nicely to how you want to use them.  That was how I thought of Apple before the iPhone, but the  iPhone and iPad have carried this to the next level.  You can buy a designer computer, or a  Wal*Mart computer.  The former has been carefully crafted to fit, the latter is just thrown out on  the shelves.  I would call that real innovation, and I'm sure that when I get my hands on an iPad, I will notice  a lot more built into the product."

Those two quotes are both from Apple CEO &lt;URL/&gt; Steve Jobs. The first was during an earnings call  in late 2008 when Jobs fielded a question about why Apple wasn't cutting prices amid the rising  success of netbooks. The second came on Wednesday as Jobs was &lt;URL/&gt; unveiling the iPad.  Apple has made it clear all along that they had no plans to build a netbook. And true to their  word, they haven't. But that doesn't mean that Apple didn't feel there was a need for a device that  resided in between a full laptop and a mobile phone — in fact, that's squarely where Apple is  positioning the iPad. With it, they feel that they've created a $500 (for the baseline version)  device that is superior to every netbook out there.  Meanwhile, Google has decided to target the market in between the laptop and the mobile phone as  well. But whereas Apple is anti-netbook, Google is very pro-netbook — they just want to make them  better. That's the reason behind Google's Chrome OS, as Google clearly laid out during &lt;URL/&gt; its  unveiling event late last year.  And so yes, we once again have Google and Apple on a collision course.  Now, it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook. At  first, &lt;URL/&gt; I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this  will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea  too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their  anti-netbook.  Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season  next year, can't like that plan too much. They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will  be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum requirements (such as big  keyboards) to manufacturing partners. But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal  of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more  like a traditional laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people.  And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need  consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from traditional software applications such  as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.  And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch. Both Apple  and Google are very popular with consumers, but their offerings are very different — while aiming  for the same market. And as two companies that were once as close as could be, it's also  fascinating to watch the tension and awkwardness as they now compete in an ever-growing number of  areas.  If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.  But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle. With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks thanks to its  pricing and Apple's positioning, everything is &lt;URL/&gt; different.&lt;br / If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.

Those two quotes are both from Apple CEO &lt;URL/&gt; Steve Jobs. The first was during an earnings call  in late 2008 when Jobs fielded a question about why Apple wasn't cutting prices amid the rising  success of netbooks. The second came on Wednesday as Jobs was &lt;URL/&gt; unveiling the iPad.  Apple has made it clear all along that they had no plans to build a netbook. And true to their  word, they haven't. But that doesn't mean that Apple didn't feel there was a need for a device that  resided in between a full laptop and a mobile phone — in fact, that's squarely where Apple is  positioning the iPad. With it, they feel that they've created a $500 (for the baseline version)  device that is superior to every netbook out there.  Meanwhile, Google has decided to target the market in between the laptop and the mobile phone as  well. But whereas Apple is anti-netbook, Google is very pro-netbook — they just want to make them  better. That's the reason behind Google's Chrome OS, as Google clearly laid out during &lt;URL/&gt; its  unveiling event late last year.  And so yes, we once again have Google and Apple on a collision course.  Now, it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook. At  first, &lt;URL/&gt; I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this  will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea  too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their  anti-netbook.  Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season  next year, can't like that plan too much. They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will  be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum requirements (such as big  keyboards) to manufacturing partners. But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal  of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more  like a traditional laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people.  And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need  consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from traditional software applications such  as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.  And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch. Both Apple  and Google are very popular with consumers, but their offerings are very different — while aiming  for the same market. And as two companies that were once as close as could be, it's also  fascinating to watch the tension and awkwardness as they now compete in an ever-growing number of  areas.  If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.  But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle. With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks thanks to its  pricing and Apple's positioning, everything is &lt;URL/&gt; different.&lt;br / If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.

Those two quotes are both from Apple CEO &lt;URL/&gt; Steve Jobs. The first was during an earnings call  in late 2008 when Jobs fielded a question about why Apple wasn't cutting prices amid the rising  success of netbooks. The second came on Wednesday as Jobs was &lt;URL/&gt; unveiling the iPad.  Apple has made it clear all along that they had no plans to build a netbook. And true to their  word, they haven't. But that doesn't mean that Apple didn't feel there was a need for a device that  resided in between a full laptop and a mobile phone — in fact, that's squarely where Apple is  positioning the iPad. With it, they feel that they've created a $500 (for the baseline version)  device that is superior to every netbook out there.  Meanwhile, Google has decided to target the market in between the laptop and the mobile phone as  well. But whereas Apple is anti-netbook, Google is very pro-netbook — they just want to make them  better. That's the reason behind Google's Chrome OS, as Google clearly laid out during &lt;URL/&gt; its  unveiling event late last year.  And so yes, we once again have Google and Apple on a collision course.  Now, it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook. At  first, &lt;URL/&gt; I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this  will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea  too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their  anti-netbook.  Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season  next year, can't like that plan too much. They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will  be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum requirements (such as big  keyboards) to manufacturing partners. But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal  of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more  like a traditional laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people.  And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need  consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from traditional software applications such  as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.  And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch. Both Apple  and Google are very popular with consumers, but their offerings are very different — while aiming  for the same market. And as two companies that were once as close as could be, it's also  fascinating to watch the tension and awkwardness as they now compete in an ever-growing number of  areas.  If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.  But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle.

Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season  next year, can't like that plan too much. They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will  be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum requirements (such as big  keyboards) to manufacturing partners. But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal  of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more  like a traditional laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people.  And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need  consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from traditional software applications such  as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.  And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch. Both Apple  and Google are very popular with consumers, but their offerings are very different — while aiming  for the same market. And as two companies that were once as close as could be, it's also  fascinating to watch the tension and awkwardness as they now compete in an ever-growing number of  areas.  If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.  But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle.

If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.  But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom  with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, &lt;URL/&gt;  leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle. With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks thanks to its  pricing and Apple's positioning, everything is &lt;URL/&gt; different.&lt;br / If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can  once again &lt;URL/&gt; find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft.
