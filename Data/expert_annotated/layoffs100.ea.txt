The Japanese people will never allow the kind of destructive mass immigration that America has  tollerated. Keep dreaming, India.  &lt;URL/&gt; http://seekingalpha.com/article/171526-japan-demographic-time-bomb-waiting-to-explode  Virtually all economics students learn that when the work force of a nation shrinks it is difficult  if not impossible to sustain economic growth and a vibrant economy.  ...  The lesson that the U.S., EU and Great Britain needs to learn from Japan is that every country’s  population is the feedstock for its economy and if we don’t take care to make sure our population  is dynamic, healthy and growing sooner or later bad economic things will happen. In Japan’s case,  large structural deficits are the byproduct of bad demographics and not the cause of its problems."
