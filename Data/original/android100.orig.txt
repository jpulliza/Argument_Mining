Imagine if you took a longtime Windows user and sat them in front of a Mac for a couple days.  
They'd probably complain about superficial things like the change in mouse acceleration and the 
unintuitive button placement (the Close button is on the opposite side of the window).  It's not 
until a week or two after you start using a Mac as your primary computer that you overcome these 
issues and begin to fully grasp some of the benefits it offers.  No, it may not be for you, but 
there's really no way you can tell for sure without taking the plunge and using one as your primary 
computer. It's the same way with Android.

I know, because I had the same experience when I made the leap from the iPhone to Android a few 
months ago.  When I got my Droid, I was initially very pleased with it: the screen is amazing and 
the device flies.  But as the luster wore off, I began to have my doubts.  I couldn't figure out 
how to access options that should have been readily visible. Menus weren't where they should have 
been.  All in all, Android made me feel stupid, because much of what I had learned about using the 
iPhone — habits that had become nearly instinct — no longer applied.

A week or so later, it clicked.  When I want an option that isn't already visible, I hit the 
dedicated `Menu' button just beneath the screen.  Need to jump to a previous screen in an app or 
the web browser? Hit the dedicated `Back' button.  In some ways, these are actually better than the 
soft buttons located in iPhone apps, because they're always in the same place.  It also saves some 
screen real estate.  Using them has become totally second nature to me.  But they aren't the reason 
why I've decided I prefer Android over the iPhone.

Which brings me to the things that have turned me into a full-time Android user.  Gmail on Android 
kicks the pants off of the iPhone's Email client — something that I'm not the <URL/> only person to 
notice.  As someone who does a lot of Emailing, that makes a *huge* difference to me.  Google Voice 
integration is fantastic.  The ability to run multiple applications at the same time is a breath of 
fresh air.  Those three things were enough to seal the deal.

Had I only used an Android device for a few days, these aforementioned pros may have been 
overshadowed by the fact that the phone felt so unfamiliar.  Or I may have been turned off by one 
of the things Android gets wrong, like that there's no way to update multiple applications at the 
same time and the default music player is remarkably ugly.  But when it comes to using the phone in 
real life on a day-to-day basis, those problems aren't enough to outweigh the productivity benefits 
Android offers me.

And, really, that's my point.  Many of these iPhone users who are testing out Android for the first 
time tend to get hung up on things that feel unfamiliar, or are griping about issues that will only 
affect them once in a blue moon.  No, Android isn't as pretty as the iPhone, and there are plenty 
of things it doesn't do as well as it could. But until you've taken the plunge to see what lies 
beneath its less-polished exterior, you haven't really seen what it has to offer.

xxx that back button is key. navigation is actually much easier on the android.

xxxxxxx Yeah, absolutely. Coming from iPhone it's a bit strange but after a few days you get the 
hang of how it (the back button) works and suddenly everything is awesome.

xxxxxxxxxxx But when we first tried the iPhone it felt natural immediately, we didn't have to 
`unlearn' old habits from our antiquated Nokias & Blackberrys.  That happened because the iPhone is 
a truly great design.

If the Nexus One was a truly great design, something that pushed things forward in anywhere near 
the way the iphone did (3 years ago!) it would be the same.

Whether its better or worse, at the end of the day the Nexus One is still just another iPhone clone.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx That's absolutely not true.  It took me a while to get used to the iPhone.  There 
were things Iiked, things I didn't and finally it was the keyboard that was the deal breaker.  I 
went to the G1 a year ago and recall getting excited about many things and chafing at the 
weaknesses (mostly hardware).

Every time I use the iPhone now, I can't believe how poor the user experience is compared to the 
Android.  The iPhone looks sexy as hell, but Android is soooooo much more usable.  I'm especially 
peeved about the back button now.  Sometimes it's on the top.  Sometimes on the bottom.  Sometimes 
on the left.  At other times on the right.   And half the time, it's not even present and I have to 
exit and restart the previous app.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I’m going to agree that my experience required a bit of getting used to… I had 
arrived to the newly minted 2G from a SE P910 but was testing a BlackBerry for development purposes 
for a few months. There was a period where I just did not like the iPhone and it had a lot to do 
with GMail and browsing. Great browser on the iPhone but, once you are set up with the information 
flow, Opera Mini can work wonders. Die BB browser, die!

I have yet to experience the Android, but would like to get a little further with development on 
the platform and need to get one at some point. Apple, and their dismissal of publishing killed my 
cash flow though! I would say that the next update or two will bring it to a solid consumer parity…

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I disagree that the iPhone just felt natural immediately... In my opinion it 
feels restrictive and over simplified, sometimes to the point of frustration.

If you only used it with the default apps that come with it then you might not have much of a 
problem, but as soon as you want to use any third party app and then quickly check your email or 
check something in a browser, the whole experience falls apart. Third party apps just exit when you 
press the home button. Quit. Gone.

Wow, what a great experience, it just feels so natural to lose what I was doing for no reason at 
all. How convenient, I can't believe nobody thought of doing that sooner!

Sorry for the sarcasm, but coming from both Android and Windows Mobile to the iPhone it's clear 
that Apple still have a way to go. Hardware buttons are necessary (capacitive buttons like on the 
Nexus One are mostly acceptable) because they make certain actions easier and quicker to perform. 
Apple will struggle to change/introduce this though because it immediately makes their old devices 
obsolete. It took them 20 something years to ship a mouse that had more than one button, but you'd 
think they would have given up on one button is all you need by now!

Android is in a really good position. One single phone design is never going to suit everybody 
because not everybody has the same needs. Some people want small devices, others like larger 
devices, others link d-pads and scroll balls, others like hardware keyboards, others like to 
handwrite and draw things with a stylus. Flexibility and choice is key. Microsoft knows this, and 
it looks like Google understand as well.

2010 will be Android's year, purely because the iPhone is old hat and Microsoft are taking too long 
to get Windows Mobile 7 out the door.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx As a Moto Droid user, I'll say that I don't like the responsiveness of the 
touch screen sometimes. I wouldn't be all that surprised if the issue lies in the software 
programming and can be corrected. The quality of the touch screen hardware is still solid in my 
opinion.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx I agree with most of what is said here. The Android phone is the winner when it 
comes to pleasing the geek crowd. I had been using an iphone since the day it came out and I'm 
currently on 3GS as my primary phone. I took Nexus on a trial basis for a week and have decided 
that it's a much better fit for a peculiar audience, primarily MIT engineers.

I gave my nexus to my dear friend who is close to finishing his masters in software engineering.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx That's very true.  With the iPhone, the sweet  goodness part of the UI is 
immediately apparent.  After a minute or two, you're feeling empowered and comfortable.

It's the weaknesses that take several days or weeks for you to really understanding and get 
frustrated by.

I never really gave much thought to how multitasking was really all that important for an iPhone 
and it didn't seem to be at first.  After using one for a while though, losing your context all the 
time as you move from one thing to another gets to be painful.   Not being able to look at an email 
without closing an ssh session or remote desktop is painful.  Oh, and the way it doesn't mount as a 
usb drive and let you do what you want with folders of video and music is painful.

On the other hand, from what I've seen with Android, it's not so much the differences in the UI, 
it's the inconsistency from one part of the UI to another.  It's the classic linux desktop problem. 
 It's so open that everything on it has its own way of working and interacting.

The best thing about Android is that it pushes the rest of the market ever harder.

Apple has such a loyal fanbase because they focus on making feel good about their gear with 
innovations that even when minor, really add up.  To wit:

Why is it that it's only my iPhone/iTouch that pauses music if the headphone jack gets unplugged?

Why is that it's only my iPhone/iTouch that changes the volume setting when I go from no headphones 
(speaker) to headphones by plugging in the jack --- then goes BACK to loud when I unplug them?

Why hasn't anyone else figured out how to let you have pause/play and volume button on the earbuds 
without making an incompatible jack?

I'm no apple fanboy --- in fact I prefer my windows 7 machines over a macbook --- but you've got to 
hand it to Apple, they do treat their users to a smooth working ui.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The reason that I am developing educational content for the iTablet/iPhone is 
that a 3 year old can pop it open and use it. That said, I believe that it could be accomplished on 
the Android as well. Also, I believe that Android will be a better platform for education 
ultimately, and more cost effective.

USER: USER_12

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The Palm Pre really does do all these things and way better than Android or the 
iPhone, but the folks at Tech Crunch don't like Palm, so even if the product is superior to 
Android, they will never admit it.

The card swiping interface is the easiest interface ever with the ability to know clearly what app 
is running or not in one click. It's easy to shut anything that you want to close with a swipe up.

All the stuff the writer of this article mentions are much more intuitive on webOS, but he acts as 
if Android is the new Jesus. Wonder if the folks at TC ever get paid or receive promotional items 
from companies they push. It's the only way to explain how they can write what they have above 
about Android while having severely dismissed in the past.

You don't have to unlearn or relearn behavior with a Palm Pre. You just swipe your cards.

What made iphone a hit was opening it to developers and thus you had amazing applications.

Iphone is good not doubt,but something can't be better then Iphone is a falsey.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Hi there,

I disagree too... some things they get right, some things they do not. Same as OSX. I have a macpro 
and a macbookpro, and on my MPB, I run Win7 as the default OS becasue I find it more intuititve and 
easy -- largely, i guess, due to the phenomenon this article author is writing about. Things like 
dragging a DVD to the trash to eject, doing a search and not being able to sort results by either 
file size or by directory path etc, things that drive me mad on OSX but for a mac person they are 
no problem.

COMMENT 17  REFERS TO: COMMENT 2   CONVERSATION 0   LEVEL 3

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The reason it felt natural was becuase you had nothing to base a comparison on. You 
had never used a phone like it before. You had no preconceptions.

Now you've used a smart phone and you have certian things you expect to be in certian places. You 
have developed preconceptions.

If the first smartphone you ever picked up was the Nexus One, it might feel just as natural as the 
iPhone does to you now.

COMMENT 18  REFERS TO: COMMENT 0   CONVERSATION 0   LEVEL 1
USER: USER_18

xxxxxxx I suppose a pervasive back-button on the iPhone wouldn't make much sense since navigation 
on the iPhone is always one app deep at a time. You'd be constantly quitting and restarting apps 
just to get back to an app that was launched three steps ago.

COMMENT 19  REFERS TO: COMMENT 18   CONVERSATION 0   LEVEL 2
USER: USER_19

xxxxxxxxxxx Right now, BGR is having a review and this back-button issue has been tackled too plus 
its touchscreen sensitivity should be adjust a little bit.

As for the opinions with the Nexus, I guess that's why this world keeps turning round and round --- 
it's because of his types of opinion that makes the

life exciting, in this case the people who believe in android/non android believers. <b|Details

xxxxxxxxxxx This is one of the things I find the most annoying when using an iPod touch. I use a 
Twitter client (or other app) and open a link to a webpage or Youtube. Once it's done I can't just 
go back to Twitter though, I have to go to home screen and then back in.

And it's not simply a matter of no multitasking on the iPhone. Even old feature phones tended to 
have working back behavior across applications.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx For 2 years, Google has carefully been following the trails of iPhone seeing their 
flaws and using it for BIG G's advantage, today on their official

statement it's clear that Google release the nexus one phone not as an iPhone Killer but a 
smartphone for the whole world. You judge now which sounds more good to you. Nexus One is something 
that has been waited for countries who didn't have the opportunity to have a high-end smartphone.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx not really. networks (and phones) in japan and korea are usually half a step, 
or a full step ahead of the rest of the world.

most of the rest of asia, including developing asia such as thailand, malaysia, indonesia, 
philippines, etc. have had 3G networks in place for years already, with users here enjoying various 
phones with high-end functions such as cut and paste, mms, multitasking, and video calling over 3G. 
even voice control has been commonplace since at least 2003, although not quite as polished and 
extensive as the android implementation.

imho, it's the US that's just catching on to the mobile craze, largely thanks to the iphone. of 
course this is only good, because once the largest market in the world catches hold, more 
innovations will be forthcoming.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Actually the only one responsible for the YouTube and Twitter multitasking is the 
app's developer.  The Facebook app allows you to watch  videos posted by friends in the YouTube app 
and once its done it returns you to the same place you were in on Facebook.  To fix this you simply 
could write a couple of negative reviews about the app (in the app store on the phone or computer) 
and more than likely it will be addressed in the next update.

I think it hilarious that people complain about features that arent even available on another 
device (my iPod touch doesnt feed me and wipe my arse).  Like the reviewer said, it seems you can’t 
find a related review, blog post, or tweet that isn’t gauging the device based on how it compares 
to Apple’s juggernaut.  This is because Apple was the first to do it and they still continue to be 
the industry leader.  These iPhone Clones are playing catchup.  Good luck with that.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx To pretend like eliminating the Apple monopoly on the

completely shortsighted.  Not everyone in the world is going to want to buy Apple's complete line 
of products to not have interoperability problems.  Android is to the smartphone what Windows was

it worked fine as long as one had a mostly flat and casual usage scenario. But once one scaled the 
usage up, the number of windows open to reach a specific file exploded.

all in all, it seems that the apple designed interfaces work ok for casual use, but never really 
scale.

Do you know why the Pre was able to get big games companies to come onboard when it is a wasteland 
in the android world? Did they pay them off? Is it various handset/builds/resolution issues?

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Google didn't evangelize game companies, Apple did. The situation is almost the 
same as the PC/Mac divide on games, back in the day.

Doesn't matter that much -- the platform's growing and the games -- and app functionality and 
design in general -- are getting better every week or so, it seems like. There's gold in them thar 
hills after all, as it turns out.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx There is no official online Android Market. However, the Mplayit Android Arcade on 
Facebook displays much of the contents of the Market, and androlib.com and cyrkit.com both 
duplicate all the Market's listings online.

Oh, there are a handful of alternate markets you can buy from, too, some with their own shop apps 
you can put on your phone. But that may be Advanced Android.

working.  Are you going somewhere else?

I do agree that the market truly sucks.  We definitely need a desktop based Market, update all, 
delete from list, better search (oh the irony!) .

After Cyrket has stopped working, I have rarely gone to the market looking for new apps.  Just too 
slow and painful.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx There is no official Android market.

Combined with Google flipping off the phone companies by obsoleting a product in a couple of months 
then bypassing them entirely by direct sales, that sure sounds like a recipe for domination against 
the iPhone. Is there somewhere I can go to take a hands-on look at Nexus One without buying one? 
No, not that obsolete Droid thing. (That's my thought and most likely the thought of many who were 
considering the Droid.) Oh, it's only mail order? So much for leveraging thousands of existing 
retail outlets where you can physically try the phone. I guess I'll just spend roughly $600 sight 
unseen. <IMAGE/> 

Once Apple releases a combo GSM/CDMA phone and every U.S. carrier can sell the iPhone, and makes a 
few software changes that permit official multitasking, we'll see who (still) dominates that market 
-- with what will be over 200,000 apps immediately and easily available.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx On the N1, I just click on the Market icon, and it takes me to a Market with pretty 
much all the apps I use. EverNote, Pandora, Foursquare, etc, are all there. Oh -- and a number of 
timers to make up for the lack of built-in timer. Not as many apps as the iPhone but I don't need 
85 fart apps.

with.

exactly how big a clusterfuck is likely to result.

xxxxxxxxxxx I am a hardcore Apple FanGirl (had all 3 gens of the iPhone, and every version of Mac 
since the G4 and iBook days). Last week, I swapped my simcard out of my iPhone into the NexusOne. 
Don't think I'm going back...

Cons:

The one thing I really miss is the *timer* built-in to the clock on the iPhone. I know, that seems 
silly, but I've used that timer a lot for cooking etc. With the NexusOne, I had to go find a timer 
*app*!

I'm also never completely certain whether an app has quit or is still in the background using 
battery, something I never had to worry about on my iPhone.

Pros:

Google Goggles totally rocks! I am amazed at the camera and ability to search with it for things 
like *wines*.

Google Voice built-in!

Maps -Wow. The maps are beautiful. And the turn-by-turn navigation is built-in!

Car-Home is a pretty kewl feature. All the right buttons for when you're in the car. Still -- it 
would be nice if the headset could initiate voice-search somehow.

The alt-tab like feature is pretty nifty.

And I kinda like the window-shade notification system.

GMail is quite nice -- although I tend to start with the oldest unread and go for newer, but I'm 
okay with the built-in way to do it.

All in all, I'm getting used to the NexusOne remarkably quickly -- and so far, really enjoying it.

I also prefer the keyboard on the N1! Surprised me but there it is.

And for zooming, it was amusing -- I tried the pinch gesture and the phone gave me a zoom option! 
Or just double tap and it works. No problem.

xxxxxxxxxxx as they say, 90% of everything is shit. So i am not surprised if the iphone have more 
quality apps, as that basically comes out of the overall number of apps available.

oh, and i recall that one can run into things like multiple apps that behave the same, but the 
information provided is area-specific, so if one want info about multiple areas, one have to get 
multiple apps.

xxxxxxx What's the retention rate on iPhone apps again? If they aren't paid for, isn't it something 
like under 5%?

Just because the iPhone has a huge amount of apps, doesn't mean they're all worth having. The free 
apps I have on my android phones are all high quality and I have used them for a year in most cases.

Then again, I suppose unlike the typical iPhone user, I don't constantly download any app I see and 
then get rid of it. If I download an app, it's because I am going to use it, like my Titter app, my 
Amazon.com app, my Fandango app, my FourSquare app and my Last.FM app. All of these are free, too, 
and high quality. In fact, I can't live without my Amazon.com app.

xxx That's refreshing to read. You've described what's wrong with many reviews on tech blogs these 
days. After reading some of the Nexus One reviews I've noticed a negative tone, partly related to 
the massive hype it got and then reviewers feeling underwhelmed, but it also seems like some people 
are mad it's not an iPhone. Stop reviewing products this way! I understand the comparison but then 
you have to look at the device alone to gauge its merits.

xxxxxxx About 40 million iPhones have been sold so far, and maybe another 25 million iPod touch's.  
This platform has the highest satisfaction rate of any tech device I've ever heard of.  The Nexus 
One has been out for 5 days.  How is then that there are so many experts here on the new phone, and 
so few advocates of the iPhone?  Is this perhaps a biased crowd?

I would also point out that once a device becomes as dominant as a software platform for mobile 
apps as the iPhone, it hardly makes sense to get anything else unless the difference is a lot 
larger than anything people are talking about here.

xxx I totally disagree.  I am a mobile phone design industry veteran.  I have an iPhone, a 
Milestone and a Nexus One.  It is plainly obvious to anyone that uses them that the iPhone is on an 
entirely different planet of usability....simply brilliant.  The two Android phones I have are, 
simply, rubbish.  The icons are tiny and fiddly, the menu layouts contravene even the most basic 
user interface design rules, they have faster processors but from are user perspective appear very 
clunky.  I could go on and on.  Three years in mobile technology is an age, yet the iPhone is still 
the benchmark: why do you think that is? Please use common sense in your articles, not Google hype.

nothing to hate about the iPhone and nothing to hate about Android (except that the G1 is extremely 
slow, and I would rather have something with a snapdragon --- I'll probably buy a new one later 
this year after I see a few more options).  I love the competition that both companies are

xxxxxxx You clearly have not used your Android phones very much. Once you get the hang of 
navigating between apps, you want to throw your iPhone out the window. Everytime on an iPhone you 
do smething that has to open another app, the only way to get back is to hit home, find the app 
again, open it (which starts it from scratch again) and then get back to the screen you were on.

You call that brilliant? It's crap and is one of the main reasons I can't stand using an iPhone for 
anything beyond web browsing. (I have to admit, the iPhone's browser is quite a bit better than 
Android's, but Android's is still perfectly usable).

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx You pick it up, and you know how to use it. Over time you adapt to preferences. 
It was simply the first phone a toddler could pick up and use. The Android is more sophisticated and Apple’s predilection to forced simplicity is evident here — one-button mice unless you go buy your own… My honest take as somebody who promotes both platforms is that over the next two iterations Android will become usable. That ”coming soon” attitude is evident in many of the comments even by fans. Developmentally, it is the same. I will be able to develop for the platform in this time, and games may become viable. We’ll see.
