<IMAGE/>

Oddly the agreement to do so has not come from the Japanese Government, but from Japan's four 
internet service provider organizations after pressure (not surprisingly) from the record and movie 
industries. <URL/> According to Torrent Freak, the agreement would see copyright holders tracking 
down file-sharers on the Internet using “special detection software” and then notifying ISPs of 
alleged infringers. File sharers will initially receive a warning for a first offense, then be 
disconnected for subsequent offenses, eventually be disconnected from the internet permanently (it 
wasn't clear whether the agreement is a three strikes proposal).

The process will formally commence in April and will primarily target users of Winny, the most 
popular file sharing network in Japan.

xxx And thus began the next phase in the continuing war.

Expect military grade encryption to become the norm and darknets to abound.  I wonder if the ISPs 
will simply make up rules that all encrypted traffic is suspect and then either demand the user 
prove that they aren't guilty or be kicked.

xxx this is just reportage catching up, or else it's different ISPs getting together on it.  I know 
because I got a note about it from my ISP in Japan in 2004.

It's important to remember that Japan is a totalitarian *society* at every level.  Groups tend to 
regulate their members pretty heavy-handedly even when government is not directly involved (as it 
does not *seem* to be here).

xxx I wonder if this will push darknets to go wireless? Those that want to share stuff could do so 
over local wifi networks completely independently of their ISPs. With Japanese population density 
being what it is, it would do the job pretty well I would think.

xxx Proposals like this one just make me laugh. There is no way this can work from a practical 
standpoint. Think about it. Internet subscribers are paying customers of the ISPs. There is no way 
the ISPs are going to be excessively aggressive since it only hurts them in the long run both in 
reputation (hurt by angry users) and in the pocket book...

So what happens then? The copyright owners are going to eventually want everyone who's file sharing 
to get punished, and once the large fish are taken care of, then comes the masses. How many 
customers do you think an ISP is going to axe before they say, hold on a second, we are getting 
hammered here...

It's a direct conflict of interest. Sure, it may allow the ISPs to say Look, we are trying hard but 
in reality they don't really want file sharing to stop, it's their bread and butter...

continue to produce content unless they are paid as a means of support, not as a means of greed.  I 
know it's not it's not a popular idea but I just had to speak up.  We all know a lot of good movies

are taking quite a juxtapose to China, as far as combating piracy goes, and this speaks multitudes

xxx I completely agree with number 11 and 13. ISPs want their money, and if it means 
sacrificrificing (not sure if I spelled that right, I've been in a spelling slump.) i.e. allowing 
file sharing, then that's a sacrifice they'll be more than willing to make. Plus, as Riza said, 
people who engage in illegal behavior on the net, they've got mad, mad skillz when it comes to 
slipping big businesses. I think they work for Microsoft XD!

Just Kidding, just kidding, but yeah. This might work for a time, but it's probably going to be a 
shortlived time. Too much money at risk and too many skill professionals(hackers...gotta love `em).

butts and put their heart, money and time into a creative project?  I wonder how many people who 
file share, I mean steal other people's work, have ever experienced making a living in a creative 
field.  We're are talking about rights concerning `intellectual property.' and the new thinking 
that it's all coming from big fat cats and big business is not correct.

Also, the internet offers a wonderful array of classes on line.  Perhaps you could download a 
college course in economics or trademark and property law.  It's really interesting stuff that

xxx oh and a final note for all the piracy is a crimers

if you buy a dvd , cd, book  or any other copy righted media

according to the current piracy laws

by letting anyone whether it be your friends or family view in any way that material you your self 
and the person shared to have committed a piracy crime whether money was obtained or not same goes 
if you pawn or sell said items as the gov and record company did not recieve any of that money or 
recieve money for the reciept of said material

thus in legal terms the only way to watch a movie or listen to music or read a book legally is to

A watch it in theaters

B wait for it top show up on tv

C listen to it on the radio

or D borrow it from a government run, or properly liscened private  library

and so according to those whove seen read or listened to anything period needs to be sued and 
jailed.

steal, the item must be gone.  And by all means, the items are all still there.  Its sharing 
people.  And people think artists are losing out.  A lot of artists make their money from touring, 
not selling albums.  Album sales matter to the companies that distribute them.  Remember long

xxx Re: #18

You must be a shill for the RIAA and others.  Truth is that file sharing in fact has been a boon to 
truly independent filmmakers and other non affiliated content producers, because they've become 
better known; it only really harms the big sharks, who have been robbing everyone blind and 
suppressing the little guy for decades.  Is it forever sustainable?  No, but turning the reins over 
to the RIAA and groups like them isn't the way to go about it.  Studies have proven people do 
prefer to do things right, file sharing and the entire music and movie industry needs to be 
re-envisioned.  A service which becomes a mix of iTunes and P2P, where independent content produces 
set their own prices, and not companies like Apple or Amazon, and where they're not ignored by Sony 
Music, Universal, etc. who before had the final say, will win against every other P2P form out 
there.  The proof exists in that music CDs remain the most popular form of distribution and in the 
correlation that as the array of music grows in services like Amazon and iTunes, the greater those 
services sales are, and the more the sales of those CDs drop.  It should be clear to anyone but the 
most casual observer that the main problem is the greed of the copyright holders to try to garner 
every penny they can as if every piece of content they owned was new and gold.  If they were to 
more reasonably pro-rate their work, on a iTunes/P2P-mix network where even the little guy can set 
their own prices, we'd ALL be a whole lot happier in the long run.

Re: #26

An excellent point.  If you expel the sharers from the internet, with technologies like wimax and 
the population density considered, a new network inevitably would form.  This network would be more 
difficult to regulate and control and allow the worse forms of human behavior a free haven.

Re: Overall

This is troubling.  At what point does banning P2P evolve into censorship and then banning all 
political dissent?  If the private interest is allowed the ability to control what their customers 
can do or say, is not fascism and despotism the only logical result?

I beg Japan to not set this example, for I fear what my country would do with it.

xxx What is the philosophy of the file-stealers?  I want it, therefore, I should be able to steal 
it?      This is what happens when you learn about the world by sitting in front of the computer 
whacking off to internet porn.   You become really, really stupid.    If you really think stealing 
is okay, then have someone steal your stuff and see if that bothers you.   Call it sharing if that 
makes any difference at all.

xxx Face it the close net workof people there will stop file sharing over the ISPs they will just 
swtch over t a big off internet wireless network instead.  They have them alreadyand they will just 
get bigger and become there own internet. This will only be a slight slow down, if some of them 
were smart they would start a wireless network you pay to access and file share.

xxx actually this is going to hurt independent artist too, file sharing is a way of unknowns to get 
known without the hassle of going through the big brother companies like sony or time warner. the 
future isnt in making money from your product, its from making money from advertisers who pay for 
the traffic on your site of for the advertising attached to your product, such as a 5 second spot 
before a song or a 30 sec commercial before and after a movie. the problem is that large companies 
are trying to put a bandaid on hemophiliac, doesnt work, and instead of forward thinking or old 
fashioned make a lemon lemonade they continue to think in a past tense. in truth, file sharing 
could be the next biggest market for advertisers, yes, let people bandie files back and forth, and 
piggie back on them. what revenue movie companies lose on downloading they will make back in 
advertising revenue, and there will always be a core of people who insist on quality, and want the 
extras that one buy a dvd for, same with music....the extras that go along with the music. but that 
would mean CEO's in these mega giants would have to become intelligent and compitent, one thing 
most executive officers in modern day corporations are not...think locust with ego.

xxx Honestly, so many people replything to this thing are so rediculous. There won't be any more 
porn? Who cares.

Secondly, piracey is illegal. You aren't sharing anything. It's just a eufimisom for STEALING, and 
that's exactly what it is. It cheats the creator out of their money. For those of you who believe 
it doesn't hurt the person (i.e. Nicole Kidman) because they are rich, perhaps you are right. 
However, it doesn't make it less of theft and it doesn't make it less wrong. Anyone who got as far 
as they did now, did it through hard work and is still working hard; it's their money and they 
deserve it. Stealing files means that one person buys it rather than the thousand that share it. If 
America follows suit it will be a good thing.

On that note however, a full out ban does seem a little extreme. There is a similar law going on in 
parts of America, the offender found downloading songs has to pay for them in the end, and much 
more than buying the albums would have cost. One college student was charge over 30,000 dollars I 
believe. For those of you who are so up in arms about this, regardless of the fact that it's 
punnishment for a crime, just like jail time for a bank robber, stop being stupid, it doesn't 
affect you that greatly yet, and likely wont.

Except for those in Japan, you wont get banned for sharing files right now. Secondly, for those in 
America, it's highly unlikely that OUR government with all it's nuances and tendencies to crumble 
under pressure, will pass any law even similar to Japan's.

Now as a last note, for all the morons:

China is more controlling of it's people than Japan (duh) there are certain BROADCASTED tv shows 
that are not allowed to air, some of them for a simple emphasis on the powerful and rich.

Japan is neither a communist or totalitarian government, they have a House of Representatives and a 
Prime Minister, and it’s not the government that pushed the law in the first place.

There are more important issues to protest than the right to commit a crime. No one would protest 
jail time to a serial killer, would they? Instead of claiming that the government should not 
enforce the law, why don’t we get bothered over things like China’s invasion of Tibet, or genocide 
in Africa, or issues like forcing preteen girls to get vaccinations that they don’t need, letting 
people who have KILLED others get away with it because it “wasn’t their fault, they fried their 
brain with drugs.”

I’m not trying to digress from the point at hand, but there are greater things to argue and protest 
than the just punishing of a crime.

xxx This is sooo stupid...there is no way they can control the internet! Plus all these people that 
are saying how stupid it is to share files...okay you're not perfect little saints either! So stop 
trying to be noble...besides getting international music for famous Jrock and Jpop artists is next 
to impossible with out file sharing. Besides sometimes if someone likes the artist enough they go 
and buy their cds so in a way they are helping artists gain more popularity so when they go tour in 
other countries they make more money! So they need to stop griping...shoot...they have more money 
than they could ever hope to spend in a lifetime!!!

humanity, not you anymore.  If you write a program, it belongs to the people who use it.  Make 
money off of supporting it!

I can't tell you how much more money I have made Microsoft by using illegal copies of their 
software by learnig it, supporting it, and then ultimately buying it for all of my customers.

Stop looking at piracy as theft, and more so as an investment!

you open, see or use this soft is own property but aren`t responsible of fail, inaccuracies, year 
2k bugs, ect.  and we use your money like we want and you must to spend, spend and spend like goofy 
and we gain, gain and again gain is a false sense of intellectual property. Don´t use legal stuff,

xxx I'm so sick of shit for brain people who think banning file sharing is somehow wrong or greedy.

   Uh, Its property rights 101 morons. Read the goddamn consitution. When some makes a product, it 
is your property. Your work. And it is up to the individual to make money or do WHATEVER THEY WANT 
WITH IT. WHY? BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY IS BASED ON PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY.

   Your neighbor can look at your lawnmower or car and say, I want that, I'll just take it But they 
don't because we have agreed to make it illegal enforced by sanction. So we don't steal from each 
other because.......WE DON'T WANT TO HAVE OUR STUFF (PROPERTY) STOLEN so we agree not to do it to 
each other.

 Duping a movie or song file without paying for it is NO DIFFERENT THAN STEALING A CAR SOMEONE HAS 
MADE WITHOUT PAYING FOR IT. Just because it is so easy to do, doesn;t justify it. How would all you 
shit for brains like it if I logged into your bank and took 10 bucks for myself now and then. WHY 
SHOULD YOU MIND? WHAT ARE YOU GREEDY?

  yes, people will always find a way around copy protection. But stealing some's work without 
permission or paying IS WRONG.

 And by the way, all you stupid fucks fall for the term file sharing like its some right to freely 
copy digital property without permission or paying for it.

 NO I'm not for the government tracking our P.C's. I 100% against it.

  Yes, the tape era wasn;t harmful. But when Digital can copy the source so well, or the internet 
makes it absurdly easy to do, then there is a problem.

 When you do this, you kill the artist or the developer of the sofware. Not to mention the jobs 
that go along with it. People who work in plastics plants, the secretarys, the salesment, the 
truckdrivers, the advertisers. ECT.

  Wake the fuck up you stupid fucks.

  God bless everyone
