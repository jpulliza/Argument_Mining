*Netbooks aren't better at anything*.

Those two quotes are both from Apple CEO <URL/> Steve Jobs. The first was during an earnings call 
in late 2008 when Jobs fielded a question about why Apple wasn't cutting prices amid the rising 
success of netbooks. The second came on Wednesday as Jobs was <URL/> unveiling the iPad.

Apple has made it clear all along that they had no plans to build a netbook. And true to their 
word, they haven't. But that doesn't mean that Apple didn't feel there was a need for a device that 
resided in between a full laptop and a mobile phone — in fact, that's squarely where Apple is 
positioning the iPad. With it, they feel that they've created a $500 (for the baseline version) 
device that is superior to every netbook out there.

Meanwhile, Google has decided to target the market in between the laptop and the mobile phone as 
well. But whereas Apple is anti-netbook, Google is very pro-netbook — they just want to make them 
better. That's the reason behind Google's Chrome OS, as Google clearly laid out during <URL/> its 
unveiling event late last year.

And so yes, we once again have Google and Apple on a collision course.

Now, it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook. At 
first, <URL/> I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this 
will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea 
too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their 
anti-netbook.

Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season 
next year, can't like that plan too much. They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will 
be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum requirements (such as big 
keyboards) to manufacturing partners. But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal 
of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more 
like a traditional laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people.

And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need 
consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from traditional software applications such 
as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. Google wants 
everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud. Apple, as they made clear 
with their overly-long iWork for iPad demo on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using 
iPhone OS-based apps.

And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch. Both Apple 
and Google are very popular with consumers, but their offerings are very different — while aiming 
for the same market. And as two companies that were once as close as could be, it's also 
fascinating to watch the tension and awkwardness as they now compete in an ever-growing number of 
areas.

If this market between laptops and smartphones proves big enough, perhaps the two frenemies can 
once again <URL/> find a common ground and band together to defeat their common enemy: Microsoft. 
But the obvious strategy for this used to be that Google would attack Microsoft from the bottom 
with its Chrome OS netbooks, while Apple attacked from the top with their premium computers, <URL/> 
leaving Microsoft squeezed in the middle. With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks thanks to its 
pricing and Apple's positioning, everything is <URL/> different.<br /

xxxxxxx iPad is not a game-changer, although it might be a budding device made for a 
non-existential market again.

Just think, what it could replace in the future? (Your Coby, PMP device, Your LCD in your Car, 
Those vtech for the kids, etc)

I believe, this year won't be an iPad year. But believe me, after 3 years.. I think we will look 
back and remember this day, why we disdain iPad so much, because it turns out on that day. iPad is 
a part of your home already.

xxxxxxx To Everyone that thinks the iPad is so much better than a netbook, and that there are no 
other multi touch devices. I tell you to look at the Asus T91MT.

It has multi touch, it has 32gb SSD, SD slots, USB ports, audio ports, web cam, tablet mode, multi 
touch track pad, fast, 6 hours of battery life, and oh yeah it's only $550.

How can the iPad be considered better, what because it runs Windows 7? A normal PC OS? That is not 
a problem, as you can get tablet specific applications if you want, there just is no need for them.

Just admit that the iPad is not innovative, and stop drinking the Apple koolaid.

xxxxxxx Care to explain exactly why Microsoft have a lack of vision?

Because looking at the Xbox 360, Windows 7 and Office 2010 you appear to be flat out wrong.

As for the clowns quacking about changing the CEO, did you look at last quarter's results?

xxxxxxxxxxx You are right on XBOX 360 -- but wrong on everything else?

Windows 7? C'mon that was just an expensive service pack to Vista. Where is the innovation in that?

Office 2010? Ribbon? Really? It's so hard to use that Microsoft had to make a game so people could 
figure out how to use its features.

Last year's annual results for Microsoft resulted in an 8 billion loss in revenue. Apple's $3.38B 
profit margin is now greater then Microsoft's $3.05B. Apple innovates. Granted, right now the iPad 
is missing features that we all expected, but to say the iPad lacks innovation because a few 
features are missing is ludicrous.

COMMENT 19  REFERS TO: COMMENT 18   CONVERSATION 1   LEVEL 4
USER: USER_19

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The main innovation in iPad is that they very carefully tailored the user 
interface for the new screen size/setup.

The Netbook user interface is essentially identical to a PC, no matter what size of screen is used. 
 No effort is put into trying to make the interface work better with the smaller screen.

For example, if I pull up a new word processing window on a netbook, it inhabits a portion of the 
screen, just as it would on a computer with a huge screen.  It seems more logical to me for it to 
take up the whole screen with a smaller size, but nobody thought of that; they just did things the 
way they have always been done.

On the iPad, all applications fill up the whole screen, just as they should to take advantage of 
the full resolution/size.  And applications will be designed to configure themselves differently 
whether on an iPhone or an iPad.  Intelligent.

Now, that's a slightly silly example, obviously.  I  can fix the problem on the netbook by hitting 
the Maximize button and then the application will fill the screen.

At the same time, it shows a genuine difference in design philosophy.

The way I look at it, Apple makes designer computers.  They are meant to look great and conform 
nicely to how you want to use them.  That was how I thought of Apple before the iPhone, but the 
iPhone and iPad have carried this to the next level.  You can buy a designer computer, or a 
Wal*Mart computer.  The former has been carefully crafted to fit, the latter is just thrown out on 
the shelves.

I would call that real innovation, and I'm sure that when I get my hands on an iPad, I will notice 
a lot more built into the product.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Obviously David Dennis hasn't actually used any tailor made netbook software.

<URL/>

<URL/> http://geeksmack.net/hardware/100-intel-and-lg-form-alliance-for-the-better.html

Both of these run applications full-screen natively, not specific netbook applications, due to the 
flexibility of Gnome, it's actually quite trivial to tell something to run fullscreen.

Applications are already configured to rearrange themselves depending on the resolution they have 
to run at.

It even conforms to how I want to use it, should I want to switch back to windowed operation like a 
standard desktop, my applications will behave there as well.

Even Google understands that netbooks should  run applications in fullscreen -- ever booted 
ChromeOS? It's just a full-screen version of Chrome with a clock.

That's just a few of the Netbook optimized options out there. The difference in design philosophy 
is certainly there, the UI's in Linux were designed with this sort of requirement in mind from day 
1, there is no upscaling required for legacy applications.

xxx I'm a fan of Apple and I expect there to be an iPad in the house within a couple of years 
(although it'll be my mum who picks one up), but even so I'm leaning towards Chrome OS and netbooks 
in general.

These days I really only use my laptop for web browsing and writing anyways, and a netbook can 
handle that perfectly well (especially one of the HP ones which have 92% keyboards and are dirt 
cheap on eBay). The rest of my media consumption (like podcasts) go straight to my iPhone.

But still, I don't exactly consider netbooks and the iPad to be on a collision course. My mum wants 
an iPad because it has a big screen and has intuitively limited functionality, and I want a netbook 
because I just need something that I can easily type on and customise the experience to what I want 
and need.

Same position in the market (in between phones and regular computers) but not on the same paths in 
my opinion. <IMAGE/>

xxx The Use Cases of a netbook and a tablet are completely different. If typing is your thing, then 
a netbook will suit. If you want a device that is easy to use on PT, a cafe, at meeting, or 
collaborating  then a tablet will prove to be more useful.

Also take the fact the Apple controls the entire experience from silicon to UI will ultimately 
tighten the user experience to the point that people won't see it like a computer, but rather a 
device (like a toaster) that is a no-brainer to use.

I just hope the frenemies are still close enough so that Google Docs can be a worth while 
experience. Tablet + Google Docs to me would be a killer application.

xxxxxxx They say prophesy is given to the fools, so I'd play the fool and predict: Apple's closed 
garden approach will eventualy FAIL.

The colision course, as I see it, is not between form factors (there are pros and cons to each) but 
between Apple's closed up, control freaked business model and Google's more open one. And I think 
google's the smarter one.

Within a couple of years you'll have a whole bunch of devices, in different sizes and form factors, 
running Chrome OS, Android, Windows or Linux (BTW Google will make money either way cuz their 
profits depend on Internet usage, not hardware sales)

Now look, I'm a UI designer, what can I use on the iPad to do my work? Currently nothing. I used to 
rely on Windows based software like Axure and Visio for it, but now I can do most of it using 
Mockingbird, iPlotz and a bunch of other web services.

I'm also a project manager. What can I use on the iPad? Zilch. On the web? Basecamp, Beehive...

Let's say you need some light image processing, where do you go?

See my point yet? When you close off your environment like Apple does, your never gonna catch up to 
the inovation possible with milions of developers working on the web.

Apple may be ahead with user experience (which I adore) but they're still playing catch up with 
real applications (iWork? Seriously?) sooner or later, the market will wake up and realize it, and 
iPads will be left for grandmothers to show pictures of their grandchildren in.

don't have a software catalogue available today ? Wow, that's surprising!

The future looks different though. Omni just announced that they will port five products to the 
iPad, at least two of which that might do the trick for what you want to do. I would be very 
surprised if Acorn or some other imaging processing app isn't ported within 6 months. Also, half of 
the tools you mentioned are web apps, why wouldn't they work on the iPad?

Finally, what's wrong with iWork? I use Keynote and Pages extensively since they fit my needs way 
better than Office.

xxxxxxxxxxx Omnigraffle is coming to the iPad which is a pretty decent competitor to Visio. 
Mockingbird is Javascript so it runs fine on something like the iPad. Basecamp works fine on the 
iPad.

There are thousands of developers dying to release apps for the iPad and if you compare what's 
available for Chrome OS to the iPhone App Store, you'll find 2 or 3 categories where Chrome OS has 
better, superior apps (due to Apple's hamfisted restrictions), but Chrome OS lags everywhere else. 
Not least in the number of developers.

COMMENT 48  REFERS TO: COMMENT 47   CONVERSATION 8   LEVEL 3
USER: USER_45

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Both of you got me wrong (hexley and Bror), which might mean i explained wrong, or 
you're too eager to defend the iPad.

The examples i gave are just current ones. Solve them and you'll have new ones.

Yes, there would be some good applications for the iPad for a lot of things, but they'll always be 
behind what's out there, both in quantity AND quality because there's simply a limit to what a 
limited number of developers can do, and there's a limit to how many applications you can cram in 
one store, and there's a limit to how many apps the Apple approval staff (or bots or whatever they 
are) can review...

Those limits are inherited in a system that is, well, limiting.

The same, perhaps even more importantly, goes for the form factor. The iPad has some good things 
going for it, industrial-design wise (like weight, speed, battery life) but also some serious 
drawbacks (i personally believe that the virtual keyboard, with the way it is implemented in this 
specific machine, will fail as a serious input device).

By giving the operating system (two of them, in fact) out to manufacturers, Google is creating a 
prosperity in form factors and encourages the creativity of those manufacturers to develop better 
solutions both technologically and ergonomically.

And let's not forget that there are other contenders as well. Microsoft had not said their last 
word in the mobile space. Nokia has been in the MID business for a while now and they're not giving 
up easily…

So, what I'm saying is not that the iPad would necessarily fail, but that the Apple approach of 
centralized, totalitarian-like control over every aspect of a product would eventually fail.

In the short term they look smarter cuz they make wonderfully crafted devices. In the long term 
they loose because people are different, and they have different needs, and they need diversity.

Either Aple opens up their approach or they start loosing what they so painfuly just recently 
gained.

xxx wants everyone to move towards using iPhone OS-based apps. or you could say they wanna bring 
people inside their tightly controlled ecosystem.

I agree these two products are on a collision course, I've heard a lot of people lately trying to 
come up with ways they'd use the iPad, and one of them is using the iPad as a web-tablet that you 
can have around the house to quickly pickup and check email or google something. Sounds a lot like 
what Google said you'd use a Chrome OS netbook for.

But you are missing one important factor that fueled netbooks popularity: price.

The cheapest iPad is 499, but when you start adding accessories and 3G, that price climbs faster 
that you can say apple tax, you're paying more for accessories that already come with netbooks (3g, 
usb, keyboard).

So you could buy a 300 bucks netbook or a 700$ iPad and still have a better web experience on a 
netbook. I'm just not seeing people buying the iPad over a netbook, I want to, but I can't.

Then there's the familiarity issue, 90% of people live in the Office/PC world, is going to be very 
hard to get people out of that world, however, is gonna be easier to get people to use the web 
version of Office on a Chrome OS netbook than to jump over to the Apple world.

Plus, a Googler said last year that they'd bring gDocs up to par with Office this year, probably to 
coincide with the Chrome OS launch, if they can deliver on providing a similar experience to 
Office, is gonna be harder for Apple to convince people to use iWork on the iPad.

That's my two cents, I have little doubt these two products are on a collision course, but I'm 
putting my money on that cost of ownership will decide the winner.

PS: Two more pieces of the puzzle.

lack of proper background multitasking on the iPad is a killer for me, as is the lack of a built-in 
memory port of any kind.  I'm ordering one ASAP just to play with it, but it'll probably gather 
dust like my iPhone 3G and my iPod Touch that I bought to play with and gave up hope on.

xxx With the iPad now clearly aimed at netbooks...

Sorry, the iPad isn't competition for a netbook. The iPad isn't a personal computer. It's a 
web-browsing/book reading device, which is also a vehicle for AAPL's content.

No multitasking, no USB input (???), no card readers, no Flash, no camera to leverage AR (and guess 
why not??), no 3G without a pricey upgrade. In other words, not a computer and certainly no 
competition for netbooks.

the iPad will fill that niche. Obviously, for more power demanding users (multi-tasking, Flash, 
higher-res screen, more storage/RAM), the iPad isn't going to lure them away from netbooks and 
cheaper laptops.

Google doesn't try to control everything. they make the software and let a whole bunch of companies

it alot and by now I prefer it in every way. It actually has every feature I really need and those 
that I need are by FAR better implemented than in OOffice and most of the times even better than MS 
Office in terms of simplicity. There are some crucial benefits like the positioning rulers that pop 
up, or the alt-arrow-key combination for inserting rows/cols that make often used actions so much 
simpler, you ask yourself how you could have lived without it. Even numbers has become great, if 
you don't need pivot-tables it's probably all you need, again, and there it's much simpler. Also, 
MS Office import / export is SO much better than in OOffice. Give it a try!

you have a net book with a touch screen.. especially why this?

xxx Great post!

I agree these two platforms are going to fight for the same business. With the number of old PC's 
still out there in most homes and businesses there is ample room for both to prosper.

Google could also compete very well with a ChromeOS tablet or an Android tablet. There are several 
Android `tablets' out there already although I'm not sure any are as large as the iPad.

I would LOVE to see some more collaboration between Google and Apple in regards to communications, 
collaboration, and productivity apps like it looks like they are with Google Maps -- iPad has a 
very compelling enterprise and SMB strategy right out of the box in the ability to leverage Google 
Apps (not to mention Salesforce.com, Workday, PracticeFusion, Zoho, Box.net, etc). I think the 
iWork Suite is really cool but I don't think it will ever be a core competency of Apple.

The tablet device has many advantages over a dedicated netbook. Ultimately it becomes the dominate 
form for the same reasons the laptop replaced the desktop. Right now it looks like Google and Apple 
will be two very significant players in this space. They'll both win big as will consumers.

Again, great post!

xxx Think about it from a developer's standpoint.  With Apple, you could develop something on the 
iPhone or iPad first, and then tweak it a little bit to work on the other device.  You only have to 
think about a max of two platforms, both with a huge base of users who have demonstrated that they 
are will to pay good money for quality apps.

Then look at Google.  You could develop something for Android, and there's no guarantee that it 
will even work on all android phones.  Plus, they have not done a good job training their users to 
pay for apps, so you'll hardly make any money even if it's one of the best apps on the platform.  
And then you can't leverage any of your android hard work on Chrome OS because the two have even 
less in common.

If developers are the difference between success and failure (as a different TC post has said 
today) then Apple has already won.  It's the ecosystem.

xxx the thing about Chrome OS is...it's not shipping. It's still in testing stages, it's still 
dependent on Google writing drivers to address the hardware in specific laptops and you may or may 
not want to use yet another laptop just because it's a netbook.

The thing that is funny to watch is when netbooks came out there was this perception that everyone 
was going to toss out their current laptop and instantly buy a netbook. When that did not happen, 
those who did toss out their laptop went OH DANG!!! I miss my laptop and then had a netbook which 
made it to craigslist and a laptop that they went back to because it never did enough for them.

iPad does solve a problem. It provides a platform for those of us who use our iPhones or Touch's to 
do certain things but wish that the screen was larger at points in time. It's not a full laptop but 
it has a screen that puts ANY netbook to shame and speedwise was quite impressive.

Sure ChromeOS when it comes out will be nice in some regards and fill some niche. However when your 
email goes out via GMAIL it is on the web and you cannot get to it. We've seen this with Gmail 
outages time and again. The iPad can either leave your email on the server of me.com or on your own 
hosted servers, or it can probably inhale it and then synch it back somewhere else later on.

ChromeOS competes with WindowsXP, VISTA, 7. It does not stack up against OSX or the iPhone OS which 
is out there on millions of platforms (touchs, iphones, and soon iPads). It will be slow in getting 
out there, no matter how many people say differently as we've seen things take time to entrench 
before.

iPad will sell. I am planning the things to add to mine already when it's home with me in around 90 
days.
