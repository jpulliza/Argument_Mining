We've confirmed with Adobe that the company is cutting 9 percent of its workforce, or 680 
employees. Adobe filed an <URL/> 8-K with the SEC today reporting the layoffs. Earlier today we 
heard multiple reports that layoffs were taking place at <URL/> Adobe.  There are also <URL/> 
Tweets about the layoffs on Twitter. Last December, Adobe <URL/> laid off 600 workers (or 8 percent 
of its staff) due to the recession.

A spokesperson for Adobe told us in a statement that Adobe is restructuring its business to align 
costs with its fiscal 2010 operating plan and budget, the companyâ€™s three-year strategic priorities 
and the realities of the business environment, as well as to ensure its ability to continue 
investing in long-term growth opportunities. In addition, after Adobe <URL/> acquired Omniture, the 
company reduced Omniture's workforce by 9 percent. According to today's filing, the restructuring 
will cost Adobe between $65 and $71 million.

We've added the layoffs to the <URL/> TechCrunch Layoff Tracker. This has been sobering week in the 
technology world, as <URL/> Electronic Arts and <URL/> Sprint both announced significant layoffs in 
the past few days.

xxx The Adobe layoffs are impacting the entire company and not just the Omniture team. High-level 
sales people, managers, partner reps, enterprise developers, and more have already been laid off. 
No one seems to know why exactly Adobe is doing these extensive layoffs, but they are nearly 
gutting entire departments especially on the West Coast.

xxx You can thank imported guest workers who are busy taking over Adobe and throwing every American 
worker they can find out. Clueless Indian managers like Anil Bhavnani who runs up and down the 
halls writing down the names of every American he can find on a yellow pad so he knows who to get 
rid of. Brilliant imported Indian managers like Bhavnani who have to ask Americans where he can get 
the MSDN CD from. Not only that but Bhavnani didn't even know how to play the Indian IT griftology 
racket -- after being laid off, he asked me to come back to work for one week only to train my 
slumdog replacement. I laughed in his face and sent him and Digby Horner an email telling them to 
learn their racket better if they were going to play that game. The company is in chaos internally 
and they have no idea what they are doing.

Or how about feature-of-the-day Viet Namese Acrobat project manager Lily Tran whose staff is 100% 
Viet Namese? No racism or Xenophobia going on there, right professor? She isn't qualified to run a 
noodle shop, let alone a software project. When I worked at Adobe and asked her for a GANTT chart, 
she didn't even know what one was. No wonder Adobe has to lay people off. Their software is junk, 
they've thrown out all the Americans out who created the company, and the place is filling up with 
3rd world losers. In a few more years expect Adobe to end up like Sun bleeding red ink. Thanks 
imported guest workers. You sure are brilliant. You sure are keeping America competitive.

Someone needs to find out how many in this layoff are Americans and how many are non-Americans. In 
the 2005 layoff it was 100% Americans laid off. Not one single foreign imported worker was laid off.

This is foreign takeover folks. That's the reason for this layoff as with others in the past.

price for their incompetence.

American-born. Since Bruce C. left the CEO post, the new CEO Chantenyu (sic---I don't feel like 
looking his ugly name up) has been gunning for Americans. IN the last 18 months, the Indian office

off in 2005 WITHOUT getting them to first train their replacements. Then he asked them to come back

xxxxxxx Amen brother! This is foreign takeover in a stealthy manner. Quite a shame at Adobe, used 
to love that company.

My employer outsourced 60% of the IT department to India under the guise of cost cutting. The 
result? 100% budget overruns and 1 years worth of projects that were total write-off failures. Not 
a single success.

Think Indian IT is smart? I actually had a discussion with an Indian brainiac programmer creating a 
payment processing system who was completely unfamiliar with electronic transfers of money between 
banks. Didn't know it existed. No I am not making this up. Wish I were.

Needless to say, that company is now in dire economic straights, and ended up wiping out the IT 
department (including outsourcing) leaving only mandatory local IT workers to keep the lights on. 
Maintenance mode only, zero improvement work.

USA has only been free market for the past 10 years and look at the result. It was Reagan's

xxxxxxx Bob, most of developers in Acrobat team are Americans. Indian folks were affected by 
layoffs as much as Americans. In all these years Adobe outsourced only one big project to India -- 
Illustrator. And that's about it. 2005 and 2009 layoffs touched mostly dying and not profitable 
projects, QA and sustaining engineering teams staffed with low level tech folks. I believe you were 
one of them.

PS. I agree about Lily Tran. She's clueless dummy.

xxxxxxxxxxx There are a few Amercians left. At one point they had laid off all the Americans and 
sent the whole project to India where it was rewritten in Java. That was so bad they had to 
ressurect the old code and start the project back up in the states. 100% of Tran's immediate staff 
are Viet Namese females -- I know -- I sat in meetings with her team. No racism going on there, 
right? When I was laid off in 2005 I was asked to come back and train my foreign replacement. If 
the project was dying, then why did someone (an Indian) replace me? I hardly think you can call 
someone who has written 22 successful commerical software products low-level. Name the software 
products you've personally written.

xxxxxxxxxxx Fruitty,

You must have left Adobe quite awhile ago. Illustrator went to India years ago. Since then the 
entire Print Publishing BU was outsourced, not just the engineering, but the marketing as well, 
went to India. Much of the localization team went to India, as well as China. IT has moved 
completely to India. All the Web production work is done from China. Adobe is outsourcing more to 
China at this time than India.  A small empire was built in the Adobe China location last year.

This is all being done in the name of saving costs, yet, in the end, Adobe is still weak (but still 
profitable I might add, just not profitable enough for the greed executive team.). Looks like these 
strategic moves to cheaper markets did little to help, but only resulted in a higher job loss rate 
in the U.S.  It didn't help that the brillian Adobe executive team purchased Omniture during these 
tough times.  The CEO strongly believes in the caste system. He doesn't give a rip about the people 
who work for him...we are beneath him. He's been known to snub employees in the elevator at work. 
Not a good man, and an even worse business man.

I worked there for a while, same floor than lily.

She's not super smart but she is a hard worker and gets job done I believe.

You are talking about non Americans. Hey man at the same floor there were these French guys who 
were really good, getting everything done on schedule all time. But maybe you haven't noticed that 
because these guys are white men so you thought they were Americans... and how about the Russians 
working on QE? These are damned good workers too. I had to deal with them on some dot release and 
these guys did work as much as needed to get all done. On the top of that, you have AMERICAN 
executives that take stupid decisions: cutting QE, cutting sales, but protecting the marketing 
junks. Look at product managers on Acrobat, these guys suck and I'm sure they are still there. In 
fact THEY are killing the product and they're Americans, man.

If you dude get a problem with that, shout yourself. You have to admit that someone better than you 
doesn't have to be an American because you're on the US territory. I worked with these Russian and 
French kids they were damn good -- better than me and I appreciated that.

It was painful to work there -- poor management, but great people. I liked the Acrobat dudes you 
are talking about, on the W16 floor right.

Peace man.

Hey, I have a great idea! I'll spend 1.8 BILLION dollars to take over a company [Omniture] that has

1/ Acquire Omniture for twice what it was really worth (6x premium on 300m in revenue, normal 
`going rate' is 3x, for Omniture that's being generous),

2/ Do that retarded `Open Government' push to PDF *and* Flash. That no one wants because it doesn't 
make sense.

So, boys and girls, if the O'bummer administration  swallows that be prepared to be tracked every 
time you pull a PDF from a *.gov site in the next few years.

I used to have some respect for Adobe, but given this `new direction' they're no better than 
spammers and spyware shysters.

Ominture will result in some layoffs but maybe their model is running out of steam?

xxx I enjoyed working at Adobe a great deal and had hoped to become a perm employee.  But they did 
tell me the main reason I got cut was because I was the last US developer on the team; after our 
lead moved into his new role, everybody else (including QA) was in India.

I have to admit I have a bit of a concern of any large US company whose CEO is from India.  It 
really makes me wonder when all of the jobs, especially jobs that would have paid well over here, 
are being moved over there.

xxxxxxx the world is flat, remember?

it is not about moving jobs here and there, it is about getting things done at a reasonable quality 
and at a cheap price. It is the same thing we witnessed back in the 90s when China became the 
central for manufacturing. India might be doing the same for software and technology..

xxxxxxxxxxx Wipro paid Tom Friedman to write The World Is Flat. It's not an idea book, it's a 
pro-India PR piece. Just wait until all the Adobe work goes to India and Adobe ends up with 
Vista-like products. Do you think sending a lot of its engineering work to India has been good for 
Microsoft? It's been a disaster. Google Quark debacle. Did I mention Apple closed all its R&D in 
India in 2006? Did I mention Apple is booming using mostly American R&D? Reasonable costs are 
useless if the products are so bad no one wants to buy them. And shovelling tons of money into a 
country that has centuries-old resentments against the west and then arming them with nuclear power 
might not be the best idea in the world. What are the *long term* implications of doing so?

Cost-cutting used to be a sign of a company in trouble. Now it's all the rage. But the world econ 
doesn't seem to be doing too well since cost-cutting took over, does it? Destroying the world's 
consumer base through cost-cutting can only lead to more disaster.

More software comes from Scandanavia than from India. Where is the Indian OS? Nearly all sotware 
projects in India fail and are brought back or canceled. Sending software work to India is the kiss 
of death for any company.

Name one new modern technology to come from India.

xxxxxxx RobG, I have to agree with you. I was at Adobe for 6 years, and loved it. I was laid off 
last year. The team I was on had a meeting shortly after the layoffs. They were told that the 
entire team would be in India within the next year or so. My first thought was, `I wonder if Bruce 
were still running the show, would this be happening?'

Then today I hear that the web store team was pretty much gutted this morning -- jobs are going to 
India.

I wonder how Warnock and Geschke feel about what's going on? I always felt that Adobe was a good 
corporate citizen...is now the time to move jobs to India??? I don't know. Sad to see this 
happening. I may have to move to India to get a job!  <IMAGE/>

Clinton passed the 2nd increase. Any president inheriting that mess would have had trouble fixing 
it. Bush's only mistake was to not repeal the increases and deport all the guest workers as 
promised.

Communists (like Bill Clinton) are the biggest free traders in the world. From each according to 
his abilities, to each according to his need. Same with the open sourcers.

Free trade has been a goal of communists since at least 1960:

xxxxxxxxxxx Is that a bad thing adobe_alum? Moving to India? I agree one should not leave the 
comfort of home, but at times like this, it doesn't hurt to travel a bit. Look at all the indians 
who do that as well. A business that is global should not necessarily be rooted to one place/region 
right? And ppl from all places are welcome to move around.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The United States is where all this technology started.  We shouldn't have to move 
to another country to get a job.  The jobs originated here and should stay here.

The East Indians come here because this same thing doesn't yet exist in India.  Jobs are moving to 
India because the cost there is cheaper, and that's because of government regulation (interference) 
with the marketplace.

I've never been a fan of regulating things like, a company must employ X percent native workers, 
but I am thinking more and more that American companies should be have AMERICAN (as in 
American-born) executives.  If somebody can prove to me that Shantanu is a naturalized US Citizen, 
then I'll shut up.  <IMAGE/> 

Otherwise, I do agree that Adobe is being converted to an East Indian company.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The logic of it started here, so should stay here is moot. If tomorrow China 
can do it cheaper and scale it better than India (which they would in a matter of less than a 
decade) most jobs would move there. Correct?

The next aspect is where is the next market? Most manufacturers/retailers are finding Asia as the 
next growth market. Still pales in comparison with US as a whole (wrt another individual country), 
but the market is most promising. China/Japan lead the way FYI. Not that this matters to be frank.

A more rational argument is to look at the best value for money. Any company would look at it 
irrespective of the sentiments attached. Look at Walmart and its influence on the local mom-pop 
shops. I would not sit and blame a country/people. I'd be more proactive looking at ways to tap 
into the potential at other places.

For a moment leave the country sentiment and think if it makes sense.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Globalization is the New Communism. Up until 1998 IT was 98% white American 
males. Even the Japanese couldn't beat us at software. What makes a 3rd world country like India 
think it can?

Americans created all this tech, but now it's being handed to India on a silver platter without 
them having to lift a finger to help create it. That's communism. From each according to his 
ability, to each according to his need. India used to be an ally of the (allegedly former) Soviet 
Union. They haven't changed their stripes, they are just fooling us. We're losing our technology to 
India and it must be stopped or the U.S. econ will only get worse. Read Gorbachev's 1987 book 
Perestroika to see how all this was laid out by the Soviets in the 60s and 80s. We need 
protectionism and we need it now. Even if Shantanu is a naturalized citizen, his loyalty still lies 
with India since he is from there. This is nothing less than the wholesale transfer of America's 
wealth and technology to India.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx By now we all know that India, Inc. pulled a fast one on America in 1998 by 
hiring professional PR/lobbying firm Hill & Knowlton to pump news stories into the U.S. media 
claiming dire economic calamity unless the U.S. opened up to mass immigration. Open up we did, and 
the current economic disaster is the result.

Now that Americans are waking up and slamming the immigration door in India's face, India is 
looking for a new pot of gold to plunder. That pot of gold is Japan. They are pumping the same fake 
news stories into the media to try to convince the Japanese to let them in in large numbers. When 
you see artilcles like this, it's obvious they were written by an Indian hack and not an American 
author due to the weird English and incorrect words like work force instead of workforce. No 
American author writes like this.

Such articles always predict impending doom for Japan due to a demographic time bomb (the exact 
same words are always used).

You need to start recognizing this kind of rant for what it is: paid-for PR written by NASSCOM or 
some Indian bodyshop looking to scavenge jobs off of other productive countries, take their 
companies over, clean out their wealth, and collapse everything.

Someone needs to be asking India, Inc. why America had a vibrant economy BEFORE the flood of cheap 
labor from abroad began and why a decade of importing them has failed to keep America's economy 
vibrant.

The Japanese people will never allow the kind of destructive mass immigration that America has 
tollerated. Keep dreaming, India.

Virtually all economics students learn that when the work force of a nation shrinks it is difficult 
if not impossible to sustain economic growth and a vibrant economy.

...

The lesson that the U.S., EU and Great Britain needs to learn from Japan is that every countryâ€™s 
population is the feedstock for its economy and if we donâ€™t take care to make sure our population 
is dynamic, healthy and growing sooner or later bad economic things will happen. In Japanâ€™s case, 
large structural deficits are the byproduct of bad demographics and not the cause of its problems.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx RobG -- You are right on the money. Overall, Adobe's a very wonderful company 
to work for, but every year, just before the holidays, they solve their financial woes by laying 
people off, and outsorcing jobs to India and China. The folks that mmake the bad decisions (the 
E-Team) retain their salaries, lucrative stock options, health benfits, etc.)  Oh, this year the 
E-Team also stuck it to the remaining employees by reducing their benefits as a cost-cutting 
measure. It is odd that all the outsourcing to India and China has not helped the company 
financially one whit.

recent request to give it free jobs. Under U.S. law, (Title 8, Section 1182), any foreign person 
working in the U.S. who adversely impacts the wages or working conditions of Americans is an 
INADMISSIBLE ALIEN. People are free to move around? Not under U.S. law they're not. I would say 
laying off Americans and moving their jobs to India is adversely impacting the wages and working 
conditions of America. Since Narayen is from India, that makes him an INADMISSIBLE ALIEN under 
Title 8, Section 1182 and he should be deported immediately. Since when do Indians understand the 
concept of laws. If I were one of you laid of Adobe workers, I'd be getting a lawyer and suing 
Adobe under U.S. laws that specifically prevent these kinds of crimes against Americans.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Indian bureaucracy ranked worst in Asia

Why aren't we importing 100,000 workers from Singapore? Or Japan? Or Germany?

Why are we only importing people from the most inefficient countries in the world?

<URL/> 
http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/news/india/Indian-bureaucracy-ranked-worst-in-Asia-Survey/article
show/4612918.cms

SINGAPORE: Singapore's civil servants are the most efficient among their Asian peers, a business 
survey on 12 economies released on Wednesday showed, but they tend to clam up unhelpfully when 
things go wrong.

India's suffocating bureaucracy was ranked the least-efficient by the survey, which said working 
with the country's civil servants was a slow and painful process.

They are a power centre in their own right at both the national and state levels, and are extremely 
resistant to reform that affects them or the way they go about their duties, the report said.
