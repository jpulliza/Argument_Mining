**A Manifesto**

I believe in <URL/> Twitter. I believe people want to use it and that it is useful to them. I'm 
less sure of its susceptibility to monetization, but then again, I cover <URL/> cameras and <URL/> 
ramen-bots, not internet business. Still, since I'm coming down to the <URL/> TechCrunch 50 
conference in a few weeks, and will likely be the only person attending who does *not* use Twitter, 
I felt I should furnish an explanation. Not that I think it really matters to anyone whether I use 
it or not, but by striking preemptively, I'll avoid talking myself hoarse in explaining it 
repeatedly to those of you I meet. I'm also curious to see if there are any other abstwainers (or 
better yet, <URL/> Tweetotallers, either way I've coined a term) in the TechCrunch readership, and 
if so, what your perspective is.

Now, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been waiting for a chance to express myself on this (which may 
be why it is so *very *long (though my parenthetical style of writing shares the blame)), but it 
seems relevant enough and the timing is right. Please bear in mind that these are <em>my own 
reasons</em> for not using the service, not reasons for you to stop; I don't mean to proselytize. 
I'll start with my primary assertion: that a tweet is fundamentally valueless.

<IMAGE/>

What is a tweet? It is a quantity of data which I believe to be useless, at least in this context. 
**What can be said in 140 characters is either trivial or abridged; in the first case it would be 
better not to say it at all, and in the second case it would be better to give it the space it 
deserves.** Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: It's a boy! for instance, is both 
sufficient and worth telling everyone you know (incidentally, congratulations to CrunchGear writer 
Matt on the new baby), but I think we all know that the bulk of Twitter is not life-changing 
announcements or granules of compact wit and wisdom. Nor is it meant to be -- but *intentions* 
aren't admissible in <em>my</em> court, sir.

To proceed: the this context I mentioned above is simply that tweets are broadcast 
indiscriminately. I think this further devalues them; an otherwise acceptable message (Brunch at 
Hi-Spot at 1!) becomes impersonal and meaningless when it's sent to so many. Yes, there is @ for 
specifying another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something else, this 
accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just exacerbates things. I like to think of it 
this way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time -- 
and shouting mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody's name before the 
mundanity. Everyone else still has to listen. Conversation is impossible; every exchange is 
telegraphic (as is, unfortunately, increasingly true in other media).

But the tweet can have a link in it, of course, which makes it more versatile -- except links are 
subject to the same value reductions as simple text. Tweeting a link is a lot like sending it to 
your whole address book. If you think *everyone you know* should see it, it better be 
<em>worth</em> shouting from the mountaintops. How rare that is! If you like other people finding 
your content for you, on their schedule, this isn't a problem, but for me it is. Add in the fact 
that probably half of tweets are automatically generated, and what we've got here is a failure to 
communicate anything of value.

The natural objection to this is that you choose to follow people, you don't have it forced upon 
you. True! I say, then, if someone is so regularly finding content of merit, why don't they have a 
*blog* where the content can be given context, discussion, and perhaps a preview so people aren't 
going in blind? I <em>like</em> reading interesting blogs. I <em>don't</em> want to receive links 
every time someone finds something they think everyone should see. Twitter just adds another layer 
to the equation -- and I don't like layers.

So there you have it. Every tweet out there is either unnecessary or unnecessarily abbreviated. Why 
would anyone *want* to be the owner of such an awkward little package of data?

<IMAGE/>

This one might be controversial, but I embrace controversy. I make it uncomfortable. I put my hands 
in its back pockets. I kiss it on the lips. Twitter, therefore, I say is an incomplete and clumsy 
service. The halo of Twitter meta-services is indicative (in my opinion) less of the popularity of 
the service and more of how it falls short of the mark. When it isn't down, Twitter provides A; 
people want A, B, and C.

It's just text, sure, that's what makes it Twitter -- but simplicity isn't the same as elegance 
(though the two are often seen together). URL-shortened image hosting services suggest people want 
to put their images right in the tweet-stream, or whatever you call it. Twitter applications like 
Tweetdeck (that's one, right?) suggest that the web service is inadequate. And so on.

One *could* exaggerate the scope of Twitter's service to being an alternative communication 
protocol at a basic level, like email or IM, and say that clients are a natural extension of that 
-- but I think that's disingenuous and wrong. Wrong because Twitter is meant to be <em>simple</em>, 
not <em>fundamental</em>. It's a significant difference. Disingenuous because you know that's not 
the case: if it were, Twitter would be better integrated with existing services.

I'm not blaming Twitter for not being what *I* would have liked it to be -- but to jump on a 
service that looks like a transitional form, so to speak, seems unwise if there is no utility in 
it. I'll get on at Twitter 2.0, thanks.

**It replaces nothing and adds nothing**

What did you do before you tweeted? It's the social equivalent of an all points bulletin, or... a 
quasar or something. What did you do before when you needed to send something of little consequence 
or urgency to a bunch of people who may or may not want to see it? The only thing that comes to 
mind is skywriting. Nowadays there are more ways than I can count. Twitter is certainly a big one, 
but is it really better, easier, or faster than its competitors -- say, Facebook's feed? To the 
untrained eye (that is to say, to *my *eye), it looks as if Facebook has Twitter humbled in many 
ways (though if I'm honest, I'm not much of a Facebooker either).

<IMAGE/>

Twitter is certainly more mobile -- that much I grant it; Facebook should be much better at that, 
and the FriendFeed acquisition should sew that up pretty tight in the months to come. Twitter is 
certainly much better for featurephones (as opposed to smartphones), but that's a bit of a moving 
target, since featurephones are getting smart and smartphones are getting cheap. If I took a 
picture of something crazy with my phone, I'd rather send it to Facebook than Twitter, though with 
Twitter it would probably reach more people, because Facebook's feed is almost as simple, and far 
more robust. It's worth mentioning here that I'm pretty much talking out of my ass, though, because 
I'm not an especially active user of Facebook, and I may have mentioned that I don't use Twitter at 
all. But if you would forbid the *argument ad ignorantium*, well, there goes the entire internet.

**News breaks alike on the followed and the unfollowed**

As for spreading news, there I can see it might be helpful for some. Not that the same news that 
gets broken on Twitter couldn't have been broken somewhere else, but Twitter news does have a 
certain something. A certain urgency, since it's part of an expanding wave of retweets, and you're 
expected to tweet it forward. I'm sure some of you are wondering how a blogger can get by without 
using Twitter (Matt Hickey is, at least). I would remind you that this article is appearing on 
TechCrunch, the world's leading source of Twitter-based news. Every tweet coming into existence has 
to be *personally approved* by Mike and MG before it appears for the rest of the internet. With 
these guys on watch, I've got nothing to worry about. (They could stand to <URL/> filter a bit more 
though)

The point is that I don't see any particular reason to use Twitter rather than, say, relying on 
Facebook or RSS or even email. If it's hot, it'll spread one way or the other. And unfortunately, I 
can't think of a less suggestive way of saying that.

Besides, (and I hate to trot out this old argument, but I think it's applicable here) weren't we 
saturated with information *before* Twitter came on the scene? Do we really need a constant hail of 
tweets in addition to the emails, IMs, messages, posts, votes, invitations, events, feeds, and god 
knows what else? I say thee nay! And on that point:

<IMAGE/>

This may sound a bit rich coming from a *professional blogger*, but I don't like to broadcast 
myself. Before this post I have tried to restrict my self-reference on this blog and CrunchGear to 
things like I'm more of a Canon guy, but... or SNES will always be superior to Genesis. I think 
advertising yourself overtly or deliberately drawing attention is in poor taste, whether it's 
tweeting your latest action, or having really big hair, or making everyone listen to your joke at a 
party. Vanity! Twitter encourages it. This is more of a philosophical point, so I won't argue it 
too much here, but it's my position that people should be saying fewer, more meaningful things, 
directed at people to whom they are relevant -- as opposed to the equivalent of sending up a signal 
flare and screaming that you super hate mondays, blah!

It appeals to the reptilian part of the brain, I think. It's an alpha male thing, having followers. 
When you're broadcasting, you get to think people are paying attention, and who doesn't like 
attention? But our attention is spread so thin these days that the portion devoted to something as 
minor as a tweet may as well be none at all. Broadcasting may console the ego, but it's false 
consolation. What it is a surrogate for (meaningful attention) can't be gotten that way.

**Why do you tweet?**

But enough of that. I could probably rattle off a couple more paragraphs on this and that, but I 
don't want to abuse the reader's patience. 1800 words is 1796 too many, when I could have simply 
pulled a Bartleby and said I prefer not to. You must understand, I thought it worth a thorough 
examining, considering TechCrunch and Twitter are joined at the hip. I console myself in that this 
article, though overlong to a degree you all will be revealing to me shortly, has still far fewer 
words than are found in an average week's posts on Twitter.

<IMAGE/>

I only forbid one answer: because everyone else is doing it. That's the same reason people wore 
Hammer pants.

[**Update**: Good to see so many responses. Very interesting. So much venom, though!]

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx More than value for business, Twitter takes most of your time. Once you get caught 
in the flurry of tweets, you're lost. There's no escape for you. Again, if you are away from 
Twitter, you lose. Because  people forget you if you don't tweet regularly. It's a catch to 
situation.

xxxxxxxxxxx Devin, there was a thrill when there was actual possibility that Twitter was about 
connecting to people but it quickly turned into a massive broadcast/link machine (@Techcunch 
included in this sin). And the Featured list really did a tremendous damage.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx This is also my problem with Twitter, it's become this bullshit marketing tool for

Techcrunch, as you said, are rightly guilty of this also.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx You got it. Any social media property will end up being a spam fest. While I do 
not personally tweet, I have experimented with clients on tweet marketing campaigns with 
surprisingly good results, but those results are only short-lived, because as more and more jump on 
the bandwagon, it will become diluted as a marketing platform. I think the service has basically 
jumped the shark, if you will, when I see some ATT wireless commercial where the kids are making 
fun  of the parents twittering and facebooking on the porch. While the commercial seems to be 
selling the idea of people doing that, strangely it has the opposite effect. Making those services 
look very uncool.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The thing about Twitter is that it started as a really cool idea --- a cloud of 
consciousness unfolding before your eyes.  Everybody's cloud was different.  It can become a cloud 
of spam if you let it, but you don't have to let it.

I never follow anyone who follows me unless I know them or their tweets are of some interest to me. 
 That's the beauty of it --- you don't have to follow anyone.

xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx it quickly turned into a massive broadcast/link machine

Exactly! I wrote a column myself like the post above, about having similar sentiments:

<URL/> 

Twitter is a sucker's game that only serves the needs of a tiny elite

The heart of it was that I didn't want to be cog in that broadcast/link machine. Many people didn't 
seem to grasp that point, and I got a lot of flack replying basically you-can-chat! But I don't 
want to chat in little public snippets.

Twitter is low-level celebrity for the chattering class. And that's not for me.

So much venom, though!

Yeah. Another celebrity aspect <IMAGE/> .

to be this insignificant?

why couldnt you tweet this;

blah blah blah im going to a nerd fair and i want to tell everyone why im so cool for not trying to 
be a sheep like all of you losers! (and i still have 6 characters left)

why couldnt you just tweet that your a moron! it would have saved us all the time.

all i read was look i can use big word to describe to everyone im a idiot.

now i realize techcrunch deserves you on the payroll. not because you try to sound smart but 
because you waste more time.

I hate to always be bad mouthing twitter but there really isn't much good to say about it so all 
you're left with is how overrated it is.

Although I think twitter is useless I like programs that measure the... volume?  of people making 
their little shouts about this or that.

It's like a giant cacophony of useless user input from people I don't care to listen to.  But when 
one collective shout starts to rise in volume above the noise it's interesting as it works like a 
gauge of what people are actively taking about in real time.

Twitter is useless; but what a great source of raw social input for data-mining the talk to of the 
day.  But considering the internet is for spam and porn I don't know if it's something worth taping 
into.

After all, your many answers to these inane comments (mine included, but who said everything has to 
be meaningful?) are like awkwardly done Twitter replies.

Also: why are there so many people named Adrian in these comments?

Twitter helped me reach people I would have had a much, much harder time reaching (and as a 
consequence it has helped to speed the growth of my business).

Would I use it if I didn't see the business value? Nope.

Twitter or no Twitter, you're wasting your talent. Just because you're fairly good at writing your 
way through a sentence doesn't mean you're actually saying anything interesting.

xxxxxxxxxxx The article has some points that I agree with. There's a lot of hype and so in the long 
run Twitter may not change the world but the model is here to stay. In the end, it may also not be 
Twitter that wins but the space and may be somewhere else.

But as an example, people will always follow celebrities for the same reason that they read and 
watch TMZ. Its also very useful from a local business model, I've found it particularly useful for 
finding deals.

Finally, the search engine is very useful. When Clinton freed the American journalists in N. Korea, 
Twitter was the best place I found to verify this when the news broke. Thus, throws on ads there 
and monetize. I defintely see the value to the service. People should question: market size, 
structure and potential winner not so much viability of model.

4.it does add something: immediacy. news spreads like wildfire. it cannot be contained. govts 
cannot hide what they do like before. it will get tweeted IMMEDIATELY and retweeted.  saying

xxxxxxx And there's mathematical proof that the value of Twitter is zero. To paraphrase Douglas 
Adams:

The number of Tweets generated is infinite (since many/most are generated automatically, we can 
assume this will only continue and grow exponentially to be an infinite number). The number of 
valuable Tweets is finite.  Any finite number divided by infinity is zero (or a number 
infinitesimally larger than, but never equal to, zero, or f/I=1/I).

would be the sum of all tweets, which as you mentioned is positive and infinite (though less 
infinite than worthless tweets).

if i write a blog, put up its link, and im being followed by a person who follows 700 other guys, 
my tweet will disappear as soon as it arrives, and only be seen when you access my profile. in 
effect, my article might not be seen by many. facebook, however, has helped drive traffic to my 
blog. still starting out, so that's what i need. feedback, criticism, and traffic. and facebook 
achieves it more i think. u have valid reasons in your post about how twitter falls short, but for 
the time being i would like to use every avenue i have to get my articles read, my writing style 
fixed, and get my topics to be more appealing. twitter helps somewhat, so ill take it!

don't know if they originated it, but it was on <URL/> The Simpsons in `91.  Chances are they 
didn't get it from a 19-year-old Cook.

journalist in Brazil, I use Twitter to reach blogs like yours which I would take a little -- too 
much -- longer to achieve if not for Twitter... and other very good sources of information. Believe 
me! It´s not only a vanity thing. I think you have a good point but, there is a good point for 
poeple of Iran and Cuba -- when they have only Twitter as a source of information to show what 
others cannot... and it can open up a seminar on the subject...

xxxxxxx So Twitter is valuable because it's short and focused and doesn't let users ramble on? 
Wait, isn't it supposed to be a SOCIAL tool? Doesn't socializing include communicating with others 
in your own personal way? What would the world be like if we all just got to the point and didn't 
ramble on? There were would basically be zero forms of entertainment or interesting conversation. 
And lets not be naive about this, Twitter was intended to be used as a form of entertainment or 
social communication -- NOT advertising your latest product.

lazy/uninteresting to write blogs. That's it.

And I like to follow interesting ppl. Not ppl I know in particular, but them also..although that's 
what facebook is for. Oh..and changing status too often on facebook will piss ppl off.

Also, I look for tweets about my company as well as watch trending topics....

I like it. Sorry <IMAGE/>

xxx I believe twitter is more of a link to news site.  Meaning that most of my 140 characters are 
usually used for a hyperlink to some information I believe is useful (to me at least, and 
therefore, hopefully useful to others).  I was a big opponent of twitter until I started using it 
regularly and following the people that I find interesting.

Also, often times the news I get on twitter comes to me faster than the main stream news sites.  
Considering the availability of information today, this is probably one of the biggest selling 
points for others as well.

xxx I tweet because well, I really don't tweet. I read tweets and follow the trends. I like the 
fact I can see what's the latest thing going on; and search real-time deeper. I like the fact, I 
can get first person views on things. I like following celebrities, CEOs, etc. to see how their 
lifestyles are. I follow all my friends and I can know exactly what's going on by watching their 
tweets and what they plan to do that night or what's going on during the week.

I have TechCrunch on sms alerts to my phone for any tweets. I feel like I am always in the loop.

However that don't stop me from arguing that you can be so plain white. What you skim read was an 
article explaining some points why twitter has it problems.

And I must tell you I agree with some, not all, but with some of them. Because rather than say I 
don't tweet, he really explained why.

Twitter shouldn't be a cult and we must see it less bright side.
