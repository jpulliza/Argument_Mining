I never really gave much thought to how multitasking was really all that important for an iPhone  and it didn't seem to be at first.

Oh, and the way it doesn't mount as a  usb drive and let you do what you want with folders of video and music is painful.

It's so open that everything on it has its own way of working and interacting.  The best thing about Android is that it pushes the rest of the market ever harder.  Apple has such a loyal fanbase because they focus on making feel good about their gear with  innovations that even when minor, really add up.

Why is that it's only my iPhone/iTouch that changes the volume setting when I go from no headphones  (speaker) to headphones by plugging in the jack --- then goes BACK to loud when I unplug them?
