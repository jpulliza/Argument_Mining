They'd probably complain about superficial things like the change in mouse acceleration and the  unintuitive button placement (the Close button is on the opposite side of the window).  It's not  until a week or two after you start using a Mac as your primary computer that you overcome these  issues and begin to fully grasp some of the benefits it offers.  No, it may not be for you, but  there's really no way you can tell for sure without taking the plunge and using one as your primary  computer. It's the same way with Android. <p> I know, because I had the same experience when I made the leap from the iPhone to Android a few  months ago.  When I got my Droid, I was initially very pleased with it:\xa0the screen is amazing and  the device flies.  But as the luster wore off, I began to have my doubts.  <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_71820 class='target'>I couldn't figure out  how to access options that should have been readily visible. Menus weren't where they should have  been.</annotator_A4>  All in all, Android made me feel stupid, because much of what I had learned about using the  iPhone —\xa0habits that had become nearly instinct —\xa0no longer applied. <p> A week or so later, it clicked.  <annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_71182 class='target'><annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_72078 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_72873 class='target'>When I want an option that isn't already visible, I hit the  dedicated `Menu' button just beneath the screen.  <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_72019 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_72729 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_73114 class='target'>Need to jump to a previous screen in an app or  the web browser? <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_80293 class='target'>Hit <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_70270 class='target'><annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_71301 class='target'>the dedicated `Back' button</annotator_A2></annotator_A1>.</annotator_A4></annotator_A3></annotator_A5>  <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_71781 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_80693 class='target'>In some ways, these are actually better than <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_70559 class='target'>the  soft buttons located in iPhone apps,</annotator_A2> because they're always in the same place.</annotator_A4></annotator_A3></annotator_A5>  It also saves some  screen real estate.  Using them has become totally second nature to me.</annotator_A1></annotator_A3>  But they aren't the reason  why I've decided <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_70333 class='target'>I prefer Android over the iPhone.</annotator_A2> <p> Which brings me to the things that have turned me into a full-time Android user.  Gmail on Android  kicks the pants off of the iPhone's Email client\xa0—\xa0something that I'm not the <URL/> only person to  notice.  As someone who does a lot of Emailing, that makes a *huge* difference to me.  Google Voice  integration is fantastic.  <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_71814 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_80322 class='target'>The ability to run multiple applications at the same time is a breath of  fresh air.</annotator_A4></annotator_A5>  Those three things were enough to seal the deal. <p> Had I only used an Android device for a few days, these aforementioned pros may have been  overshadowed by the fact that the phone felt so unfamiliar.  Or I may have been turned off by one  of the things Android gets wrong, like that there's no way to update multiple applications at the  same time and the default music player is remarkably ugly.  But <annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_73198 class='target'>when it comes to using the phone in  real life on a day-to-day basis, those problems aren't enough to outweigh the productivity benefits  Android offers me.</annotator_A3> <p> And, really, that's my point.  <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_70324 class='target'><annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_72229 class='target'><annotator_A3

Third party apps just exit when you  press the home button. Quit. Gone. <p> <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_71757 class='callout'>Wow, what a great experience, it just feels so natural to lose what I was doing for no reason at  all. How convenient, I can't believe nobody thought of doing that sooner!</annotator_A4> <p> Sorry for the sarcasm, but coming from both Android and Windows Mobile to the iPhone it's clear  that Apple still have a way to go. Hardware buttons are necessary (capacitive buttons like on the  Nexus One are mostly acceptable) because they make certain actions easier and quicker to perform.  Apple will struggle to change/introduce this though because it immediately makes their old devices  obsolete. It took them 20 something years to ship a mouse that had more than one button, but you'd  think they would have given up on one button is all you need by now! <p> <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_70776 class='target'>Android is in a really good position.</annotator_A2> One single phone design is never going to suit everybody  because not everybody has the same needs. Some people want small devices, others like larger  devices, others link d-pads and scroll balls, others like hardware keyboards, others like to  handwrite and draw things with a stylus. Flexibility and choice is key. Microsoft knows this, and  it looks like Google understand as well. <p> 2010 will be Android's year, purely because the iPhone is old hat and Microsoft are taking too long  to get Windows Mobile 7 out the door. <p> COMMENT 6  REFERS TO: COMMENT 3   CONVERSATION 0   LEVEL 4 USER: USER_7 <p> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx <annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_71315 class='callout'>As a Moto Droid user, I'll say that I don't like the responsiveness of the  touch screen sometimes.

Last week, I swapped my simcard out of my iPhone into the NexusOne.  Don't think I'm going back... <p> Cons: <p> The one thing I really miss is the *timer* built-in to the clock on the iPhone. I know, that seems  silly, but I've used that timer a lot for cooking etc. With the NexusOne, I had to go find a timer  *app*! <p> I'm also never completely certain whether an app has quit or is still in the background using  battery, something I never had to worry about on my iPhone. <p> Pros: <p> Google Goggles totally rocks! I am amazed at the camera and ability to search with it for things  like *wines*. <p> Google Voice built-in! <p> Maps -Wow. The maps are beautiful. And the turn-by-turn navigation is built-in! <p> Car-Home is a pretty kewl feature. All the right buttons for when you're in the car. Still -- it  would be nice if the headset could initiate voice-search somehow. <p> The alt-tab like feature is pretty nifty. <p> And I kinda like the window-shade notification system. <p> GMail is quite nice -- although I tend to start with the oldest unread and go for newer, but I'm  okay with the built-in way to do it. <p> All in all, I'm getting used to the NexusOne remarkably quickly -- and so far, really enjoying it. <p> COMMENT 72  REFERS TO: COMMENT 71   CONVERSATION 2   LEVEL 3 USER: USER_54 <p> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxx Since I can't edit, I'm going to add: <p> I also prefer the keyboard on the N1!
