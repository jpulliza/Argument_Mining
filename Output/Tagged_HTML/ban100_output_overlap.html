<p> xxx oh and a final note for all the piracy is a crimers
<p> if you buy a dvd , cd, book or any other copy righted media
<p> according to the current piracy laws
<p> by letting anyone whether it be your friends or family view in any way that material you your self and the person
    shared to have committed a piracy crime whether money was obtained or not same goes if you pawn or sell said items
    as the gov and record company did not recieve any of that money or recieve money for the reciept of said material
<p> thus in legal terms the only way to watch a movie or listen to music or read a book legally is to
<p> A watch it in theaters
<p> B wait for it top show up on tv
<p> C listen to it on the radio
<p> or D borrow it from a government run, or properly liscened private library
<p> and so according to those whove seen read or listened to anything period needs to be sued and jailed.

        <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_82457 class='target'>Truth is that file sharing in fact has been a boon to
            truly independent filmmakers and other non affiliated content producers, because they've become better
            known;
        </annotator_A5>
        it only really harms the big sharks, who have been robbing everyone blind and suppressing the little guy for
        decades. Is it forever sustainable? No, but turning the reins over to the RIAA and groups like them isn't the
        way to go about it.
        <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_80355 class='target'>Studies have proven people do prefer to do things
            right, file sharing and the entire music and movie industry needs to be re-envisioned.
        </annotator_A2>
        A service which becomes a mix of iTunes and P2P, where independent content produces set their own prices, and
        not companies like Apple or Amazon, and where they're not ignored by Sony Music, Universal, etc. who before had
        the final say, will win against every other P2P form out there. The proof exists in that music CDs remain the
        most popular form of distribution and in the correlation that as the array of music grows in services like
        Amazon and iTunes, the greater those services sales are, and the more the sales of those CDs drop. It should be
        clear to anyone but the most casual observer that
        <annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_80829 class='target'>the main problem is the greed of the copyright
            holders

        to try to garner every penny they can as if every piece of content they owned was new and gold. If they were to
        more reasonably pro-rate their work, on a iTunes/P2P-mix network where even the little guy can set their own
        prices, we'd ALL be a whole lot happier in the long run.

    yes, let people bandie files back and forth, and piggie back on them. what revenue movie companies lose on
    downloading they will make back in advertising revenue, and there will always be a core of people who insist on
    quality, and want the extras that one buy a dvd for, same with music....the extras that go along with the music. but

                            a eufimisom for STEALING, and that's exactly what it is.

        It cheats the creator out of their money.
    </annotator_A2>
    </annotator_A3> For those of you who believe it doesn't hurt the person (i.e. Nicole Kidman) because they are rich,
    perhaps you are right. However, it doesn't make it less of theft and it doesn't make it less wrong. Anyone who got
    as far as they did now, did it through hard work and is still working hard; it's their money and they deserve it.
    Stealing files means that one person buys it rather than the thousand that share it. If America follows suit it will
    be a good thing.</annotator_A1>
<p> On that note however, a full out ban does seem a little extreme. There is a similar law going on in parts of
    America, the offender found downloading songs has to pay for them in the end, and much more than buying the albums
    would have cost. One college student was charge over 30,000 dollars I believe. For those of you who are so up in
    arms about this, regardless of the fact that it's punnishment for a crime, just like jail time for a bank robber,
    stop being stupid, it doesn't affect you that greatly yet, and likely wont.
<p> Except for those in Japan, you wont get banned for sharing files right now. Secondly, for those in America, it's
    highly unlikely that OUR government with all it's nuances and tendencies to crumble under pressure, will pass any
    law even similar to Japan's.
<p> Now as a last note, for all the morons:
<p> China is more controlling of it's people than Japan (duh) there are certain BROADCASTED tv shows that are not
    allowed to air, some of them for a simple emphasis on the powerful and rich.
<p>
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_80482 class='callout'>Japan is neither a communist or totalitarian government,
        they have a House of Representatives and a Prime Minister, and it’s not the government that pushed the law in
        the first place.
    </annotator_A2>
<p> There are more important issues to protest than the right to commit a crime. No one would protest jail time to a
    serial killer, would they? Instead of claiming that the government should not enforce the law, why don’t we get
    bothered over things like China’s invasion of Tibet, or genocide in Africa, or issues like forcing preteen girls to
    get vaccinations that they don’t need, letting people who have KILLED others get away with it because it “wasn’t
    their fault, they fried their brain with drugs.”
<p> I’m not trying to digress from the point at hand, but there are greater things to argue and protest than the just
    punishing of a crime.

            getting international music for famous Jrock and Jpop artists is next to impossible with out file sharing.
            Besides sometimes if someone likes the artist enough they go and buy their cds so in a way they are helping
            artists gain more popularity so when they go tour in other countries they make more money!

<p> xxx Knowledge belongs to the people. End of story. If you publish a song. It belongs to humanity, not you anymore.
    If you write a program, it belongs to the people who use it. Make money off of supporting it!
<p> I can't tell you how much more money I have made Microsoft by using illegal copies of their software by learnig it,
    supporting it, and then ultimately buying it for all of my customers.
<p> Stop looking at piracy as theft, and more so as an investment!

    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_82540 class='target'>Remember using legal software without assuming
        responsability, with state like: Read this, if you open, see or use this soft is own property but aren`t

    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_82608 class='callout'>I'm so sick of shit for brain people who think banning
        file sharing is somehow wrong or greedy.
    </annotator_A5>
<p> Uh, Its property rights 101 morons. Read the goddamn consitution. When some makes a product, it is your property.
    Your work. And it is up to the individual to make money or do WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH IT. WHY? BECAUSE OUR COUNTRY
    IS BASED ON PROTECTION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY.
<p> Your neighbor can look at your lawnmower or car and say, I want that, I'll just take it But they don't because we
    have agreed to make it illegal enforced by sanction. So we don't steal from each other because.......WE DON'T WANT
    TO HAVE OUR STUFF (PROPERTY) STOLEN so we agree not to do it to each other.
<p> Duping a movie or song file without paying for it is NO DIFFERENT THAN STEALING A CAR SOMEONE HAS MADE WITHOUT
    PAYING FOR IT. Just because it is so easy to do, doesn;t justify it. How would all you shit for brains like it if I
    logged into your bank and took 10 bucks for myself now and then. WHY SHOULD YOU MIND? WHAT ARE YOU GREEDY?
<p>
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_80523 class='callout'>yes, people will always find a way around copy
        protection. But stealing some's work without permission or paying IS WRONG.

    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_80214 class='callout'>
        <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_82559 class='callout'>And by the way, all you stupid fucks fall for the
            term file sharing like its some right to freely copy digital property without permission or paying for it.
    </annotator_A2>
    </annotator_A5>
<p> NO I'm not for the government tracking our P.C's. I 100% against it.
<p> Yes, the tape era wasn;t harmful. But when Digital can copy the source so well, or the internet makes it absurdly
    easy to do, then there is a problem.
<p> When you do this, you kill the artist or the developer of the sofware. Not to mention the jobs that go along with
    it. People who work in plastics plants, the secretarys, the salesment, the truckdrivers, the advertisers. ECT.
<p> Wake the fuck up you stupid fucks.
<p> God bless everyone
