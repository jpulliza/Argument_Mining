The first was during an earnings call  in late 2008 when Jobs fielded a question about why Apple wasn't cutting prices amid the rising  success of netbooks. The second came on Wednesday as Jobs was <URL/> unveiling the iPad. <p> <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_50917 class='target'><annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_51351 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_51896 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52574 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52815 class='target'>Apple has made it clear all along that they had no plans to build a netbook.</annotator_A4></annotator_A3> And true to their  word, they haven't.</annotator_A5> But that doesn't mean that Apple didn't feel there was a need for a device that  resided in between a full laptop and a mobile phone — in fact, that's squarely where Apple is  positioning the iPad. <annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_50236 class='target'>With it, <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_51177 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_52013 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52582 class='target'>they feel that <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_51109 class='target'>they've created <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40453 class='target'>a $500 (for the baseline version)</annotator_A4>  device</annotator_A2> that is superior to every netbook out there.</annotator_A1></annotator_A4></annotator_A3></annotator_A5> <p> <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_53014 class='target'>Meanwhile, Google has decided to target the market in between the laptop and the mobile phone as  well.</annotator_A5> But whereas <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40680 class='target'>Apple is anti-netbook</annotator_A2>, Google is very pro-netbook — they just want to make them  better. That's the reason behind Google's Chrome OS, as Google clearly laid out during <URL/> its  unveiling event late last year. <p> <annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_51726 class='target'>And so yes, we once again have Google and Apple on a collision course.</annotator_A3> <p> <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52729 class='target'>Now, <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40324 class='target'>it remains to be seen if people who buy an iPad will do so instead of buying a netbook</annotator_A2>.</annotator_A5> At  first, <URL/> I'm not so sure that will be the case. But it stands to reason that eventually, this  will happen. And as Jobs' comments on stage on Wednesday made abundantly clear, that's Apple's idea  too. In their eyes, you shouldn't buy a cheap, underpowered PC, you should buy an iPad, their  anti-netbook. <p> <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40299 class='target'><annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_50928 class='target'>Google, which plans to release its first Chrome OS-based netbooks in time for the holiday season  next year</annotator_A2>, can't like that plan too much.</annotator_A4> They have promised that netbooks that run Chrome OS will  be better than current netbooks because they're dictating certain minimum\xa0requirements\xa0(such as big  keyboards) to manufacturing partners.\xa0But Chrome OS netbooks won't be able to match the sex appeal  of the iPad's multi-touch screen. However, what they can offer is a familiar experience (much more  like a\xa0traditional\xa0laptop then an iPad), and that will be appealing to a lot of people. <p> And what's interesting is that for either of the two to be massive hits, they both will need  consumers to continue to feel comfortable moving away from\xa0traditional\xa0software applications such  as Microsoft Office. But their plans to get consumers to do that are very different. <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40215 class='target'><annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_50943 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_52074 class='target'><annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52601 class='target'>Google wants  everyone to move towards doing everything on their apps in the cloud.</annotator_A2> <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40401 class='target'><annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_50426 class='target'><annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_51997 class='target'>Apple, as they made clear  with their overly-long <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40564 class='target'>iWork for iPad demo</annotator_A2> on Wednesday, wants everyone to move towards using  iPhone OS-based apps.</annotator_A2></annotator_A1></annotator_A4></annotator_A3></annotator_A5> <p> <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52610 class='target'>And that's why this battle coming at the end of this year will be interesting to watch.

I miss my laptop and then had a netbook which  made it to craigslist and a laptop that they went back to because it never did enough for them. <p> iPad does solve a problem. It provides a platform for those of us who use our iPhones or Touch's to  do certain things but wish that the screen was larger at points in time. It's not a full laptop but  it has a screen that puts ANY netbook to shame and speedwise was quite impressive. <p> Sure ChromeOS when it comes out will be nice in some regards and fill some niche. However when your  email goes out via GMAIL it is on the web and you cannot get to it. We've seen this with Gmail  outages time and again. The iPad can either leave your email on the server of me.com or on your own  hosted servers, or it can probably inhale it and then synch it back somewhere else later on. <p> ChromeOS competes with WindowsXP, VISTA, 7. It does not stack up against OSX or the iPhone OS which  is out there on millions of platforms (touchs, iphones, and soon iPads). It will be slow in getting  out there, no matter how many people say differently as we've seen things take time to entrench  before. <p> iPad will sell.
