Earlier today we  heard multiple reports that layoffs were taking place at <URL/> Adobe.  There are also <URL/>  Tweets about the layoffs on Twitter.

According to today's filing, the restructuring  will cost Adobe between $65 and $71 million. <p> We've added the layoffs to the <URL/> TechCrunch Layoff Tracker.

Since then the  entire Print Publishing BU was outsourced, not just the engineering, but the marketing as well,  went to India. Much of the localization team went to India, as well as China. IT has moved  completely to India. All the Web production work is done from China. Adobe is outsourcing more to  China at this time than India.  A small empire was built in the Adobe China location last year.</annotator_A2> <p> This is all being done in the name of saving costs, yet, in the end, Adobe is still weak (but still  profitable I might add, just not profitable enough for the greed executive team.). Looks like these  strategic moves to cheaper markets did little to help, but only resulted in a higher job loss rate  in the U.S.  It didn't help that the brillian Adobe executive team purchased Omniture during these  tough times.  The CEO strongly believes in the caste system. He doesn't give a rip about the people  who work for him...we are beneath him. He's been known to snub employees in the elevator at work.
