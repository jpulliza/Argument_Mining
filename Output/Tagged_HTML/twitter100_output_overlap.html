<p> **A Manifesto**
<p> I believe in
    <URL/>
    Twitter. I believe people want to use it and that it is useful to them. I'm less sure of its susceptibility to
    monetization, but then again, I cover
    <URL/>
    cameras and
    <URL/>
    ramen-bots, not internet business. Still, since I'm coming down to the
    <URL/>
    TechCrunch 50 conference in a few weeks, and will likely be the only person attending who does *not* use Twitter, I
    felt I should furnish an explanation. Not that I think it really matters to anyone whether I use it or not, but by
    striking preemptively, I'll avoid talking myself hoarse in explaining it repeatedly to those of you I meet. I'm also
    curious to see if there are any other abstwainers (or better yet,
    <URL/>
    Tweetotallers, either way I've coined a term) in the TechCrunch readership, and if so, what your perspective is.
<p> Now, I'd be lying if I said I hadn't been waiting for a chance to express myself on this (which may be why it is so
    *very *long (though my parenthetical style of writing shares the blame)), but it seems relevant enough and the
    timing is right. Please bear in mind that these are <em>my own reasons</em> for not using the service, not reasons
    for you to stop; I don't mean to proselytize.
    <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_51034 class='target'>I'll start with my primary assertion: that

<p> What is a tweet? It is a quantity of data which I believe to be useless, at least in this context.

    </annotator_A3> in the first case it would be better not to say it at all, and in the second case it would be better
    to give it the space it deserves.</annotator_A5>** Of course, there are exceptions to this rule: It's a boy! for
    instance, is both sufficient and worth telling everyone you know (incidentally, congratulations to CrunchGear writer
    Matt on the new baby), but I think we all know that the bulk of Twitter is not life-changing announcements or
    granules of compact wit and wisdom. Nor is it meant to be -- but *intentions* aren't admissible in <em>my</em>
    court, sir.
<p> To proceed:
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52785 class='target'>the this context I mentioned above is simply that
        <annotator_A1 id=opposition_Instance_50205 class='target'>
            <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_51286 class='target'>tweets are broadcast indiscriminately
        </annotator_A1>
        .</annotator_A4> I think this further devalues them;
        <annotator_A3 id=opposition_Instance_51738 class='target'>an otherwise acceptable message (Brunch at Hi-Spot at
            1!) becomes impersonal and meaningless when it's sent to so many.
        </annotator_A3>
        Yes, there is @ for specifying another tweet or Twitterer (would that they had called the site something else,
        this accursed bird-based jargon drives me mad), but that just exacerbates things. I like to think of it this
        way: Twitter is a bunch of friends sitting around a table, all shouting at the same time -- and shouting
        mundanities at that. The @ function just means you shout somebody's name before the mundanity. Everyone else
        still has to listen.
    </annotator_A5>
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40323 class='target'>Conversation is impossible; every exchange is
        telegraphic
    </annotator_A2>
    (as is, unfortunately, increasingly true in other media).
<p> But the tweet can have a link in it, of course, which makes it more versatile -- except links are subject to the
    same value reductions as simple text. Tweeting a link is a lot like sending it to your whole address book. If you
    think *everyone you know* should see it, it better be <em>worth</em> shouting from the mountaintops. How rare that
    is! If you like other people finding your content for you, on their schedule, this isn't a problem, but for me it
    is. Add in the fact that probably half of tweets are automatically generated, and what we've got here is a failure
    to communicate anything of value.
<p> The natural objection to this is that you choose to follow people, you don't have it forced upon you. True! I say,
    then, if someone is so regularly finding content of merit, why don't they have a *blog* where the content can be
    given context, discussion, and perhaps a preview so people aren't going in blind? I <em>like</em> reading
    interesting blogs. I <em>don't</em> want to receive links every time someone finds something they think everyone
    should see. Twitter just adds another layer to the equation -- and I don't like layers.
<p> So there you have it.
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52851 class='target'>Every tweet out there is either unnecessary or
        unnecessarily abbreviated.
    </annotator_A5>
    Why would anyone *want* to be the owner of such an awkward little package of data?
<p>
    <IMAGE/>
<p> This one might be controversial, but I embrace controversy. I make it uncomfortable. I put my hands in its back
    pockets. I kiss it on the lips. Twitter, therefore, I say is an incomplete and clumsy service. The halo of Twitter
    meta-services is indicative (in my opinion) less of the popularity of the service and more of how it falls short of
    the mark. When it isn't down, Twitter provides A; people want A, B, and C.
<p> It's just text, sure, that's what makes it Twitter -- but simplicity isn't the same as elegance (though the two are
    often seen together). URL-shortened image hosting services suggest people want to put their images right in the
    tweet-stream, or whatever you call it. Twitter applications like Tweetdeck (that's one, right?) suggest that the web
    service is inadequate. And so on.
<p> One *could* exaggerate the scope of Twitter's service to being an alternative communication protocol at a basic
    level, like email or IM, and say that clients are a natural extension of that -- but I think that's disingenuous and
    wrong. Wrong because Twitter is meant to be <em>simple</em>, not <em>fundamental</em>. It's a significant
    difference. Disingenuous because you know that's not the case: if it were, Twitter would be better integrated with
    existing services.
<p> I'm not blaming Twitter for not being what *I* would have liked it to be -- but to jump on a service that looks like
    a transitional form, so to speak, seems unwise if there is no utility in it. I'll get on at Twitter 2.0, thanks.

<p> What did you do before you tweeted?
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52513 class='target'>It's the social equivalent of an all points bulletin,
        or... a quasar or something. What did you do before when you needed to send something of little consequence or
        urgency to a bunch of people who may or may not want to see it?
    </annotator_A5>
    The only thing that comes to mind is skywriting. Nowadays there are more ways than I can count. Twitter is certainly
    a big one, but is it really better, easier, or faster than its competitors -- say, Facebook's feed? To the untrained
    eye (that is to say, to *my *eye), it looks as if Facebook has Twitter humbled in many ways (though if I'm honest,
    I'm not much of a Facebooker either).
<p>
    <IMAGE/>
<p> Twitter is certainly more mobile -- that much I grant it; Facebook should be much better at that, and the FriendFeed
    acquisition should sew that up pretty tight in the months to come. Twitter is certainly much better for
    featurephones (as opposed to smartphones), but that's a bit of a moving target, since featurephones are getting
    smart and smartphones are getting cheap. If I took a picture of something crazy with my phone, I'd rather send it to
    Facebook than Twitter, though with Twitter it would probably reach more people, because Facebook's feed is almost as
    simple, and far more robust. It's worth mentioning here that I'm pretty much talking out of my ass, though, because
    I'm not an especially active user of Facebook, and I may have mentioned that I don't use Twitter at all. But if you
    would forbid the *argument ad ignorantium*, well, there goes the entire internet.

<p>
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40595 class='target'>
        <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52827 class='target'>As for spreading news, there I can see it might be
            helpful for some.
    </annotator_A2>
    Not that the same news that gets broken on Twitter couldn't have been broken somewhere else, but Twitter news does
    have a certain something.</annotator_A5> A certain urgency, since it's part of an expanding wave of retweets, and
    you're expected to tweet it forward. I'm sure some of you are wondering how a blogger can get by without using
    Twitter (Matt Hickey is, at least). I would remind you that this article is appearing on TechCrunch, the world's
    leading source of Twitter-based news. Every tweet coming into existence has to be *personally approved* by Mike and
    MG before it appears for the rest of the internet. With these guys on watch, I've got nothing to worry about. (They
    could stand to
    <URL/>
    filter a bit more though)
<p>
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52460 class='target'>The point is that I don't see any particular reason to use
        Twitter rather than, say, relying on Facebook or RSS or even email. If it's hot, it'll spread one way or the
        other.
    </annotator_A5>
    And unfortunately, I can't think of a less suggestive way of saying that.
<p> Besides, (and I hate to trot out this old argument, but I think it's applicable here) weren't we saturated with
    information *before* Twitter came on the scene? Do we really need a constant hail of tweets in addition to the
    emails, IMs, messages, posts, votes, invitations, events, feeds, and god knows what else? I say thee nay! And on
    that point:
<p>
    <IMAGE/>
<p> This may sound a bit rich coming from a *professional blogger*, but I don't like to broadcast myself. Before this
    post I have tried to restrict my self-reference on this blog and CrunchGear to things like I'm more of a Canon guy,
    but... or SNES will always be superior to Genesis. I think advertising yourself overtly or deliberately drawing
    attention is in poor taste, whether it's tweeting your latest action, or having really big hair, or making everyone
    listen to your joke at a party.

        Twitter encourages it.

    </annotator_A4></annotator_A3></annotator_A5>
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52672 class='target'>This is more of a philosophical point, so I won't argue it
        too much here,
        <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52542 class='target'>but it's my position that people should be saying
            fewer, more meaningful things,
        </annotator_A5>
        directed at people to whom they are relevant -- as opposed to the equivalent of sending up a signal flare and
        screaming that you super hate mondays, blah!
    </annotator_A5>
<p> It appeals to the reptilian part of the brain, I think. It's an alpha male thing, having followers. When you're
    broadcasting, you get to think people are paying attention, and who doesn't like attention? But our attention is
    spread so thin these days that the portion devoted to something as minor as a tweet may as well be none at all.
    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52426 class='target'>Broadcasting may console the ego, but it's false
        consolation. What it is a surrogate for (meaningful attention) can't be gotten that way.

<p>
    <annotator_A4 id=opposition_Instance_50918 class='target'>**Why do you tweet?**</annotator_A4>
<p> But enough of that. I could probably rattle off a couple more paragraphs on this and that, but I don't want to abuse
    the reader's patience.
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40029 class='target'>1800 words is 1796 too many, when I could have simply
        pulled a Bartleby and said I prefer not to.
    </annotator_A2>
    You must understand, I thought it worth a thorough examining, considering
    <annotator_A2 id=opposition_Instance_40136 class='target'>TechCrunch and Twitter are joined at the hip
    </annotator_A2>
    . I console myself in that this article, though overlong to a degree you all will be revealing to me shortly, has
    still far fewer words than are found in an average week's posts on Twitter.
<p>
    <IMAGE/>
<p> I only forbid one answer: because everyone else is doing it. That's the same reason people wore Hammer pants.
<p> [**Update**: Good to see so many responses. Very interesting. So much venom, though!]

                        takes most of your time. Once you get caught in the flurry of tweets, you're lost. There's no
                        escape for you. Again, if you are away from Twitter, you lose. Because people forget you if you
                        don't tweet regularly. It's a catch to situation.

<p> xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx The thing about Twitter is that it started as a really cool idea --- a cloud of consciousness
    unfolding before your eyes. Everybody's cloud was different. It can become a cloud of spam if you let it, but you
    don't have to let it.
<p> I never follow anyone who follows me unless I know them or their tweets are of some interest to me. That's the
    beauty of it --- you don't have to follow anyone.

<p> Exactly! I wrote a column myself like the post above, about having similar sentiments:
<p>
    <URL/>
<p> Twitter is a sucker's game that only serves the needs of a tiny elite
<p> The heart of it was that I didn't want to be cog in that broadcast/link machine. Many people didn't seem to grasp
    that point, and I got a lot of flack replying basically you-can-chat! But I don't want to chat in little public
    snippets.
<p> Twitter is low-level celebrity for the chattering class. And that's not for me.
<p> So much venom, though!
<p> Yeah. Another celebrity aspect

    so all you're left with is how overrated it is.
<p> Although I think twitter is useless I like programs that measure the... volume? of people making their little shouts
    about this or that.
<p> It's like a giant cacophony of useless user input from people I don't care to listen to. But when one collective
    shout starts to rise in volume above the noise it's interesting as it works like a gauge of what people are actively
    taking about in real time.
<p> Twitter is useless; but what a great source of raw social input for data-mining the talk to of the day. But
    considering the internet is for spam and porn I don't know if it's something worth taping into.

            There's a lot of hype and so in the long run Twitter may not change the world but the model is here to stay.

        In the end, it may also not be Twitter that wins but the space and may be somewhere else.

<p> But as an example, people will always follow celebrities for the same reason that they read and watch TMZ. Its also
    very useful from a local business model, I've found it particularly useful for finding deals.
<p> Finally, the search engine is very useful. When Clinton freed the American journalists in N. Korea, Twitter was the
    best place I found to verify this when the news broke. Thus, throws on ads there and monetize. I defintely see the
    value to the service. People should question: market size, structure and potential winner not so much viability of
    model.

<p> The number of Tweets generated is infinite (since many/most are generated automatically, we can assume this will
    only continue and grow exponentially to be an infinite number). The number of valuable Tweets is finite. Any finite
    number divided by infinity is zero (or a number infinitesimally larger than, but never equal to, zero, or f/I=1/I).

    i write on average a blog a day, but take some vacations. i find a weakness in twitter other than what u have
    mentioned.
<p> if i write a blog, put up its link, and im being followed by a person who follows 700 other guys, my tweet will
    disappear as soon as it arrives, and only be seen when you access my profile. in effect, my article might not be
    seen by many. facebook, however, has helped drive traffic to my blog. still starting out, so that's what i need.
    feedback, criticism, and traffic. and facebook achieves it more i think.

<p> xxx I tweet because well, I really don't tweet. I read tweets and follow the trends. I like the fact I can see
    what's the latest thing going on; and search real-time deeper. I like the fact, I can get first person views on
    things. I like following celebrities, CEOs, etc. to see how their lifestyles are. I follow all my friends and I can
    know exactly what's going on by watching their tweets and what they plan to do that night or what's going on during
    the week.
<p> I have TechCrunch on sms alerts to my phone for any tweets. I feel like I am always in the loop.

        <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52493 class='callout'>However that don't stop me from arguing that you can

    <annotator_A5 id=opposition_Instance_52871 class='callout'>And I must tell you I agree with some, not all, but with
        some of them. Because rather than say I don't tweet, he really explained why.

        following for much longer than Twitter has been around.
